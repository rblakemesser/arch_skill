# AGENTS.md

This repo ships installable agent skills. `skills/` is the main live runtime
surface. `Makefile` may also install explicitly listed vendored skills from
`vendor/`; `Makefile` plus `README.md` own the install surface for Codex,
Claude Code, and Gemini.

## Build And Verify

- After skill package changes under `skills/`, run `npx skills check`.
- Use `make verify_install` only when you intentionally changed or want to
  validate the installed skill surface.
- If you change install behavior, also verify the affected paths and commands
  in `README.md` and `Makefile`.
- If you change only doctrine or docs, re-read the edited files and verify any
  commands or paths you added with `rg`. Do not imply that code verification
  ran when it did not.

## Definition Of Done

- The touched surface is internally consistent.
- Required verification for that surface ran, or the final reply says plainly
  why it did not.
- `README.md` or the relevant docs are updated when skill names, routing,
  or install behavior changed.
- New doctrine stays concise, command-first, and points to deeper truth
  instead of copying large reference text into always-on context.

## Red Lines

- Do not use external model consultation or delegation workflows unless the
  user explicitly asks for code review, fresh consult, second opinion,
  completion audit, or delegated agent work.
- Do not delete user work, untracked files, or repo changes unless the user
  explicitly asks for that exact cleanup. If you are not sure whether a file
  came from your own run, leave it alone and ask.
- Treat changes outside your intentional edit scope as user-owned, even if they
  appear while you are working. Do not reverse-apply, restore, checkout, or
  "clean up" those files to tidy your diff. If a command rewrites unrelated
  tracked files, report the exact paths and ask before undoing them.
- Do not make shipped skills depend on archived command files at runtime.
- Do not revive archived command surfaces as part of the live runtime.
- Do not edit vendored plugin packages unless the task is explicitly updating
  that vendor source; route repo-specific install behavior through `Makefile`
  and docs instead.
- Skill doctrine must be self-contained. Do not explain it with historical
  backstory or the skill development process itself. The only exception is a
  coordinator skill whose job is to explain how other skills fit together.
- Skill authoring must preserve agent judgment. `skills/<slug>/SKILL.md` is
  the runtime contract and should tell the agent how to inspect context, choose
  actions, execute thoughtfully, and verify the result.
- Scripts in a skill may only be narrow helpers for deterministic mechanics
  such as command syntax, parsing, templating, validation, or API calls. Do not
  make a skill a thin wrapper around a script, runner, controller, or harness
  that owns the workflow or removes the agent's reasoning.
- Author skills as direct v1 agent guidance. Include only the requested
  workflow: the job, key context to inspect, expected output, and verification
  to run. Leave out invented checks, conditions, refusal paths, cross-checks,
  edge-case policy, and exception lists.
- Do not write unit tests that lock skill doctrine to exact wording. Avoid
  tests that read `skills/<slug>/SKILL.md`, skill reference docs, prompt
  doctrine, or usage docs only to assert phrase or regex presence/absence.
  Test deterministic behavior, schemas, package shape, install inventory,
  helper scripts, and runtime output instead; use `npx skills check` plus
  review for doctrine quality.
- Keep changes in the smallest owning surface: reusable workflow doctrine in
  `skills/`, install behavior and stale-surface cleanup in `Makefile`, and
  deeper reference material in `docs/`.

## Skill Routing

- Use `$skill-authoring` for new, edited, refactored, or audited skill
  packages.
- Use `$agents-md-authoring` for `AGENTS.md` authoring or refactors.
- Use `$figma-best-practices` when the user wants Figma file-craft,
  component-library, variables/token, Dev Mode, Code Connect, Make, Sites,
  Buzz, Slides, or MCP-readiness guidance.
- Use `$fal-ai-tools` when the user wants to use fal.ai tools, models, MCP,
  SDK/API calls, background removal, media generation or editing, model
  discovery, schema lookup, pricing, upload, inference, or result polling.
- If the user wants to execute one of the shipped workflows, use the matching
  split skill instead of reviving the archived pre-skill surface.
- Use `$arch-step` when the user wants explicit full-arch commands such as
  `new`, `reformat`, `research`, `deep-dive`, `external-research`,
  `phase-plan`, `plan-enhance`, `fold-in`, `overbuild-protector`,
  `consistency-pass`, `review-gate`, `implement`,
  `audit-implementation`, `status`, or `advance`.
- Use `$arch-flow` for read-only checklist and next-step inspection.
- Use `$arch-skills-guide` when the user asks which arch skill to use or how
  the suite is divided.
- Use `$stepwise` when the user wants to run an ordered multi-step process
  (named in another repo's doctrine) with a fresh sub-session per step and a
  per-step critic that resumes the same session on fail.
- Use `$arch-epic` when the user has a goal too big for one `$arch-step` plan
  and wants to decompose it into ordered sub-plans, approve the decomposition
  up front, run each sub-plan through arch-step's `new` → `auto-plan` →
  `implement-loop` → `audit-implementation` arc, and have a fresh critic check
  for scope drift between sub-plans before advancing.
- Use `$skill-flow` when the user wants to design, repair, or audit an ordered
  flow of multiple agent skills with distinct jobs, concrete handoffs, and
  clear peer boundaries. For 30+ skill suites or any multi-skill audit driven
  by a scope phrase (e.g. "audit every skill in this project", "audit the
  skills for flow F1"), the DAG-grounded audit sub-mode walks the suite in
  parallel sub-agents, builds a labeled-edge substrate at
  `<doc-dir>/<doc-slug>_DAG.md`, and surfaces wasted-energy patterns
  (over-promotion, redundancy, dead skills, broken refs) with `path:line`
  evidence.
- Use `$fresh-consult` when the user or another skill wants one or more
  clean-context Claude, Codex, Cursor Agent, or Grok second opinions on a
  concrete artifact, completion claim, flow consistency question, or
  readability/confusion check.
- Use `$commit-history-authoring` when the user wants the current branch's
  local-only commit messages rewritten into informative history while
  preserving patches and commit boundaries by default.
- Use `$agent-delegate` when the user wants one or more fresh Claude, Codex,
  Cursor Agent, or Grok subprocesses to do concrete work in the current
  workspace, including implementation, editing, investigation-and-fix, command
  execution, or installed-skill use.
- Use `$plan-audit` when the user wants an existing planning artifact in any
  format audited before work starts for plan quality, outcome clarity, real
  ambiguity, constraints, repo/code truth, depth-first risk, side doors,
  required deletes, drift-proofing, or proof gaps; or when they want code
  already written for a plan reviewed against that plan's architecture and
  code-quality bar. Its `implementation-audit` mode is plan-backed code review
  only: it does not run tests, ask for logs, prove CI, investigate honesty, or
  replace `$code-review` for generic diffs and PRs.
- Use `$plan-implement` when the user wants to implement an existing plan,
  phase, section, checklist, issue-body plan, or design doc while keeping the
  plan, plan-audit log, implementation log, proof freshness, and warm
  plan-backed review aligned. It is the lightweight implementation lane: use
  native subagents when helpful, but do not manually spawn `codex`, `claude`,
  `agent`, or `grok` executables or turn the work into an external worker
  swarm.
- Use `$plan-swarm` when the user wants to implement a named phase or phase
  range from an existing plan document by having the parent agent decompose
  the phase into independently delegable slices, launch or resume parallel
  Codex, Claude, Cursor Agent, or Grok workers through `$agent-delegate`,
  coordinate scarce verification manually, write worklogs next to the plan,
  and close only after arbiter and thermonuclear findings are triaged.
- Use `$model-consensus` when the user wants two selected Claude, Codex,
  Cursor Agent, or Grok models to iterate on a plan, architecture, design, or
  concept until they converge or expose the smallest unresolved decision, including
  adversarial simplification. The parent agent orchestrates directly; do not
  introduce a deterministic runner, script, controller, or harness layer.
- Use `$thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review` only when the user explicitly wants
  a thermonuclear, code-judo, or especially harsh maintainability review. Use
  `$code-review` for ordinary code review requests.

## Writing And Replies

- Write for a human reader first.
- Use plain English. Do not make the reader decode house jargon, compressed
  labels, or pseudo-technical wording.
- Lead with the concrete thing in 1-3 sentences: what changed, what to run,
  what happens next, or what the blocker is.
- If the real answer is a path, command, setting, or skill name, name that
  exact thing first.
- Prefer simple action language over doctrine language. If the rule is simple,
  write the simple rule.
- Say `Only AGENTS.md changed, so I didn't run tests.` when that is the truth.

## Docs Map

- `README.md` for install targets, supported tools, and the current skill
  inventory.
- `CLAUDE.md` as a thin Claude Code shim that imports `AGENTS.md`; do not
  duplicate repo rules there.
- `docs/arch_skill_usage_guide.md` for workflow selection and intended usage.
- `skills/<slug>/SKILL.md` for the runtime contract of a specific shipped
  skill.
- `vendor/cursor/plugins/cursor-team-kit/` for the vendored MIT Cursor Team Kit
  package that supplies `thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review`.
