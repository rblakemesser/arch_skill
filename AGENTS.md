Do not use external multi-model consultation workflows unless the user explicitly asks for a code review.

Verification:
- After skill package changes, run `npx skills check`.
- Use `make verify_install` only when you intentionally want to validate the installed skill surface.

Routing:
- Use `$skill-authoring` for new, edited, refactored, or audited skill packages.
- Use `$agents-md-authoring` for `AGENTS.md` authoring or refactors.
- Use `$arch-step` for the old saved-prompt full-arch flow when the user wants prompt-close commands like `new`, `reformat`, `research`, `deep-dive`, `phase-plan`, `plan-enhance`, `fold-in`, `review-gate`, `implement`, `audit-implementation`, `advance`, or concise full-arch status.
- Use `$arch-flow` for read-only checklist and next-step inspection.
