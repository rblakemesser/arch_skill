description: Add a depth-first phased implementation plan to the architecture doc.
argument-hint: DOC_PATH=<path>
---
Execution rule: do not block on unrelated dirty files in git; ignore unrecognized changes. If committing, stage only files you touched (or as instructed).
Do not preface with a plan or restate these instructions. Begin work immediately. If a tool-call preamble is required by system policy, keep it to a single terse line with no step list. Console output must ONLY use the specified format; no extra narrative.
Insert a depth-first phased plan at the top of $DOC_PATH.
Each phase must include: Goal, Work, Test plan, Exit criteria, Rollback.
More phases are better than fewer. Keep them concrete.
Write the phased plan block into $DOC_PATH (insert at top). Do not paste the full block to the console.

DOCUMENT INSERT FORMAT (insert at top):
