description: "00a) Reformat: convert an existing doc into canonical arch_skill format (preserve content; infer TL;DR + North Star; ask for confirmation)."
argument-hint: "<Include a path to the existing doc (docs/<...>.md or any .md). Optional: OUT=docs/<...>.md to write to a new file instead of editing in place.>"
---
# /prompts:arch-reformat — $ARGUMENTS
Execution rule: do not block on unrelated dirty files in git; ignore unrecognized changes. If committing, stage only files you touched (or as instructed).
Do not preface with a plan or restate these instructions. Begin work immediately. If a tool-call preamble is required by system policy, keep it to a single terse line with no step list. Console output should be short and high-signal (no logs); see CONSOLE OUTPUT for required content.
Inputs: $ARGUMENTS is freeform steering (user intent, constraints, random notes). Process it intelligently.

Resolve DOC_PATH:
- If $ARGUMENTS includes `OUT=...`, treat that as the output path and the first `.md` path as the input DOC_PATH.
- Otherwise, if $ARGUMENTS includes any `.md` path, use that as DOC_PATH.
- Otherwise ask the user to provide the doc path (offer 2–3 candidates if you can find them).

Documentation-only (planning):
- This prompt edits markdown documentation only. DO NOT modify code.
- Do not commit/push unless explicitly requested in $ARGUMENTS.

# COMMUNICATING WITH AMIR (IMPORTANT)

- Start console output with a 1 line reminder of our North Star.
- Then give the punch line in plain English.
- Then give a short update in natural English (bullets optional; use them only if they improve clarity).
- Never be pedantic. Assume shorthand is intentional (long day); optimize for the real goal.
- Put deep details (commands, logs, exhaustive lists) in DOC_PATH, not in console output.

---

# North Star (authoritative)
Take an existing architecture/plan doc that is **not** in the canonical `arch_skill` format and convert it into the canonical format **without losing content**.

Definition of “convert”:
- Preserve all information from the original doc (links, code blocks, decisions, TODOs, open questions, call-site notes, etc.).
- Structure it into the standard template (below), placing content into the most appropriate sections.
- Fill what you can by **extracting** and **summarizing** from the existing doc (do not invent new facts).
- If you infer something, label it clearly as a *draft inference* and base it on explicit text from the source doc.
- If something is truly missing, keep a placeholder/TODO rather than hallucinating.

Hard rules:
- Do not delete any meaning-bearing content. If you can’t confidently place a piece of text, put it in Appendix A (Imported Notes).
- Do not “rewrite from scratch”. Re-organize + lightly edit for clarity only when it helps; keep original wording when it carries nuance.
- Do not introduce new scope. You may clarify scope only if it’s already implied in the source doc.
- Keep the **single-document rule**: everything stays in the output doc; do not create sidecar planning docs.

---

# Procedure (do this exactly; optimize for correctness over prettiness)
1) Read DOC_PATH fully and treat it as the source of truth for content.
2) Create the canonical document skeleton (see TEMPLATE below).
3) Populate the skeleton by **mapping** content from the source doc:
   - Move/merge existing sections into the best-fitting canonical sections.
   - Prefer placing content once (avoid duplication), unless duplication is the only safe way to avoid losing information.
   - Preserve code fences, tables, and links exactly.
4) Add a short “Conversion Notes” appendix:
   - What major chunks you moved (high level).
   - Anything that couldn’t be confidently categorized (points to Appendix A).
   - Any gaps/TODOs that remain after extraction.
5) Ensure the template’s **TL;DR** and **0) Holistic North Star** are drafted from the existing content (no placeholders there unless the source doc truly lacks enough info).
6) Write the updated doc back:
   - If OUT is provided: write the canonical output to OUT and leave DOC_PATH unchanged.
   - Otherwise: rewrite DOC_PATH in-place into canonical format.
7) Pause and ask the user to confirm/correct the drafted North Star (yes/no).

Do not paste the full document to the console. You may print only the drafted TL;DR + North Star for confirmation.

# 0) Holistic North Star

## 0.1 The claim (falsifiable)
> <If we do X, then Y is true, measured by Z, by date/condition W>

## 0.2 In scope
- UX surfaces (what users will see change):
  - <screen/state/flow>
- Technical scope (what code will change):
  - <module/contract/boundary>

## 0.3 Out of scope
- UX surfaces (what users must NOT see change):
  - <screen/state/flow>
- Technical scope (explicit exclusions):
  - <module/boundary we will not touch>

## 0.4 Definition of done (acceptance evidence)
- <observable acceptance criteria, not vibes>
- Evidence plan (common-sense; non-blocking):
  - Primary signal (keep it minimal; prefer existing tests/checks): <existing test/check OR instrumentation/log signature OR manual QA checklist> — <what you’ll look for>
  - Optional second signal (only if needed): <...> — <what you’ll look for>
  - Default: do NOT add bespoke screenshot harnesses / drift scripts unless they already exist in-repo or are explicitly requested.
  - Avoid negative-value tests/gates: do NOT add “deleted code not referenced” tests, visual-constant tests (colors/margins/pixels), doc-driven inventory gates, or mock-only interaction tests.
- Metrics / thresholds (if relevant):
  - <metric>: <threshold> — measured via <dash/test/log>

## 0.5 Key invariants (fix immediately if violated)
- <if these fail, fix before continuing>
- Example: “No silent fallbacks.” “No dual sources of truth.” “No undefined behavior.”

# 1) Key Design Considerations (what matters most)

## 1.1 Priorities (ranked)
1) <#1>
2) <#2>
3) <#3>

## 1.2 Constraints
- Correctness:
- Performance:
- Offline / latency:
- Compatibility / migration:
- Operational / observability:

## 1.3 Architectural principles (rules we will enforce)
- <e.g., fail-loud boundaries, DI rules, no business logic in UI, etc.>
- Pattern propagation via comments (high leverage; no spam):
  - When we introduce a new SSOT/contract or a non-obvious “gotcha”, add a short doc comment in the canonical boundary module explaining the invariant + how to extend it safely.
  - Do NOT comment everything; comment the tricky bits we want to propagate forward.

## 1.4 Known tradeoffs (explicit)
- <tradeoff> → chosen direction + why
- Alternatives rejected + why

# 2) Problem Statement (existing architecture + why change)

## 2.1 What exists today
- <system overview in 5–10 bullets>
- Primary flows / control paths:
  - <flow A>
  - <flow B>

## 2.2 What’s broken / missing (concrete)
- Symptoms:
- Root causes (hypotheses):
- Why now:

## 2.3 Constraints implied by the problem
- <constraints derived from reality, not preference>

---

# 3) Research Grounding (external + internal “ground truth”)

## 3.1 External anchors (papers, systems, prior art)
- <source> — <what we borrow / what we reject> — <why it applies>

## 3.2 Internal ground truth (code as spec)
- **Authoritative behavior anchors (do not reinvent):**
  - `<path>` — <what it defines>
- **Existing patterns we will reuse:**
  - `<path>` — <pattern>

## 3.3 Open questions from research
- Q1:
- Q2:
- What evidence would settle them:

# 6) Call-Site Audit (exhaustive change inventory)

## 6.1 Change map (table)
| Area     | File   | Symbol / Call site | Current behavior | Required change | Why         | New API / contract | Tests impacted |
| -------- | ------ | ------------------ | ---------------- | --------------- | ----------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| <module> | <path> | <fn/cls>           | <today>          | <diff>          | <rationale> | <new usage>        | <tests>        |

## 6.2 Migration notes
* Deprecated APIs:
* Compatibility shims (if any):
* Delete list (what must be removed):

---

# 7) Depth-First Phased Implementation Plan (authoritative)

> Rule: systematic build, foundational first; every phase has exit criteria + explicit verification plan (tests optional).

## Phase 1 — <foundation>
* Goal:
* Work:
* Verification (smallest signal):
* Docs/comments (propagation; only if needed):
* Exit criteria:
* Rollback:

## Phase N — <end state + cleanup>
* Goal:
* Work:
* Verification (smallest signal):
* Docs/comments (propagation; only if needed):
* Exit criteria:
* Rollback:

---

# 8) Verification Strategy (common-sense; non-blocking)

> Principle: avoid verification bureaucracy. Prefer the smallest existing signal. If sim/video/screenshot capture is flaky or slow, rely on targeted instrumentation + a short manual QA checklist and keep moving.
> Default: 1–3 checks total. Do not invent new harnesses/frameworks/scripts unless they already exist in-repo and are the cheapest guardrail.
> Default: keep UI/manual verification as a finalization checklist (don’t gate implementation).
> Default: do NOT create “proof” tests that assert deletions, visual constants, or doc inventories. Prefer compile/typecheck + behavior-level assertions only when they buy confidence.
> Also: document any new tricky invariants/gotchas in code comments at the SSOT/contract boundary so future refactors don’t break the pattern.

## 8.1 Unit tests (contracts)
* What invariants are unit-locked:

## 8.2 Integration tests (flows)
* Critical flows:
* Failure injection:

## 8.3 E2E / device tests (realistic)

CONSOLE OUTPUT (Amir-style; north star confirmation):
This is the information it should contain but you should communicate it naturally in english not as a bulleted list that is hard to parse for the user.
Include:
- North Star reminder (1 line; what we’re trying to accomplish overall)
- Punchline (1 line; what you need from Amir right now)
- Doc path (output)
- Draft TL;DR (outcome/problem/approach/plan)
- Draft North Star for confirmation (claim/scope/definition-of-done/key invariants)
- Ask Amir to confirm “yes/no” (and paste edits if “no”)
