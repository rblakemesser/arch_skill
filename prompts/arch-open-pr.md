# /prompts:arch-open-pr — $ARGUMENTS
# COMMUNICATING WITH USERNAME (IMPORTANT)
You are doing the “get the PR live fast, then let CI be the referee” finalization pass.

- Start console output with a 1 line reminder of our North Star.
- Then give the punch line in plain English.
- Keep console output high-signal; deep logs/long outputs go in a file if needed.

Execution rule: do not block on unrelated dirty files in git; ignore unrecognized changes. If committing, stage only files you touched (or as instructed).
Do not preface with a plan or restate these instructions. Begin work immediately.
$ARGUMENTS is freeform steering (title ideas, intent, constraints). Infer what you can.

Question policy (strict):
- You MUST answer anything discoverable from code/tests/CI config/docs or by running repo tooling; do not ask me.
- Allowed questions only:
  - Missing access/permissions (e.g., can’t push, can’t open PR)
  - Irreducible ambiguity about “what PR are we opening?”

Goal:
Get the current branch into a state where:
1) it cleanly incorporates the latest default branch (usually `origin/main`),
2) it preserves a credible recent green signal, or runs a targeted post-merge smoke check when risk changed,
3) it is pushed, and
4) the PR is opened as a **draft** with a detailed, template-based description.
5) if CI runs on PRs, we watch it to completion and report whether the PR is mergeable.

Modes (keep it simple):
- Default = FAST: open the PR quickly; avoid re-running suites we already ran.
- If $ARGUMENTS includes `parity` / `full`: run the CI-equivalent checks locally (can take a while).
- If $ARGUMENTS includes `no-watch`: do not watch CI.

## 1) Sync with default branch (thoughtful merge)
- Identify the repo’s default branch from git (prefer `origin/main`, otherwise `origin/HEAD`).
- Ensure we are on a feature branch (not the default branch) before doing PR work. If we’re on the default branch, create a branch with a sensible name.
- Ensure changes are safely committed before merging:
  - If there are in-progress changes you created, commit them (stage only what you touched).
  - Do not sweep unrelated local files into commits.
- Run `git fetch origin`, then merge the default branch into the feature branch (this is the conflict check):
  - Prefer an explicit merge commit: `git merge --no-ff <default>` (usually `origin/main`).
  - If there are conflicts: resolve them, `git add` the resolutions, then complete the merge (`git commit` if needed).
- If conflicts occur: resolve them thoughtfully using repo conventions and our intended behavior.
  - If a conflict forces a real product/UX decision not in the repo, stop and ask with the smallest possible question.

## 2) Local checks (post-merge smoke; FAST = minimal)
Default (FAST):
- Prefer to rely on the latest credible local signal already captured in DOC_PATH/worklog plus PR CI.
- Do NOT re-run long suites we already ran earlier in this work unless the merge introduced conflicts, there is no recent relevant green signal, or we changed behavior after that last known green run.
- Run a post-merge smoke check only when the merge actually changed risk:
  - merge conflicts occurred,
  - the merge diff touches executable/runtime code, build/test infra, or release wiring,
  - or you lack a recent relevant green signal to lean on.
- When a smoke check is needed, choose the smallest targeted build/test that proves the merge did not break basics.
- Decide whether to run additional local checks using judgment plus one quick signal:
  - If `git merge` reported `Already up to date.`, treat the merge as a no-op and skip local checks.
  - Otherwise, quickly inspect what the merge introduced via `git diff --name-only ORIG_HEAD..HEAD` (fallback: `git diff --name-only HEAD@{1}..HEAD` if `ORIG_HEAD` is unusable).
  - If the diff is clearly irrelevant (docs-only / comments), skip local checks and proceed to opening the PR.
  - If the diff touches risky areas but your last credible green signal already covers them and the merge was clean, you may still skip reruns; document why in the PR notes/worklog.
  - Avoid heavy setup/install steps unless a check fails and indicates missing deps.

If $ARGUMENTS includes `parity` / `full`:
- Derive what CI actually runs from workflows/scripts and run the closest local equivalent until green.

## 3) Finalize commits + push
- Ensure the branch has clean commits for review (not “temp debug”).
- Stage only files you touched; keep commits cohesive.
- Push the branch to origin (set upstream if needed).

## 4) Open a draft PR with the repo’s template (repo-relative)
Before opening the PR: if this repo has an explicit docs policy / doc lifecycle policy (in `AGENTS.md`, `docs/AGENTS.md`, `docs/ORIENTATION_ARTIFACT_MAP.md`, or similar), follow it first (e.g., required doc summaries, moving plan docs to the right place, not committing huge raw logs/artifacts, adding `gitignore` rules). Do not invent new policy; obey only what’s clearly specified.

Before opening/submitting the PR, re-check that we’re still synced to the latest default branch tip:
- Run `git fetch origin`.
- If `<default>` has moved since your merge (i.e., `git log HEAD..<default> --oneline` shows any commits), go back to step (1) and merge again. Do not open a PR that’s immediately “out of date”.

Produce a PR title + body that is detailed and matches THIS repo’s template:
- Load the PR template from THIS repo (repo-relative), preferring:
  - `.github/pull_request_template.md`
  - (alternate) `.github/pul_request_template.md`
  - (alternate) `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
- Fill it in with specifics from the actual diff:
  - What changed and why (user impact + technical summary)
  - How it was tested (commands + results)
  - Gotchas / sharp edges worth propagating (and where they’re documented in code comments)
  - Risks/rollout/monitoring notes (if applicable)
  - Screenshots/logs/QA notes if relevant

Then open the PR:
- ALWAYS open the PR as a **draft** (never “ready for review” by default).
- If a PR already exists for the branch, do not create a duplicate:
  - Ensure it is in draft mode (GitHub UI: “Convert to draft”, or `gh pr ready --undo`), then print the URL.
- If GitHub CLI `gh` is available and authenticated, create the PR as a draft and print the URL (use `gh pr create --draft …`).
- Otherwise, print the prepared title + body clearly so USERNAME can paste it (and provide the exact `gh pr create --draft …` command to run).
- If using the GitHub web UI, choose “Create draft pull request”.

## 5) Watch PR CI (default)
If CI checks run on PRs, prefer to watch them to completion so we know whether the PR is green/mergeable:
- If GitHub CLI `gh` is available and authenticated: run `gh pr checks --watch` for this PR.
- Summarize whether checks are green, and if not, which check failed and the smallest next action.
- Skip CI watching if $ARGUMENTS includes `no-watch`.

OUTPUT FORMAT (console only; USERNAME-style):
This is the information it should contain but you should communicate it naturally in english not as a bulleted list that is hard to parse for the user.
Include:
- North Star reminder (1 line)
- Punchline (1 line)
- What you did (merge + checks you ran)
- Result (green/red; what’s blocking if red)
- What got committed + pushed (branch name + commits)
- PR status (opened URL or ready-to-paste title/body)
- CI status (watched/pending; mergeable or what failed)
- Need from USERNAME (only if required)
