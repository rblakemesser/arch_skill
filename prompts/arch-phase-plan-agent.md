# /prompts:arch-phase-plan-agent — $ARGUMENTS
Execution rule: do not block on unrelated dirty files in git; ignore unrecognized changes. If committing, stage only files you touched (or as instructed).
Do not preface with a plan or restate these instructions. Begin work immediately. If a tool-call preamble is required by system policy, keep it to a single terse line with no step list. Console output should be short and high-signal (no logs); see OUTPUT FORMAT for required content.
Inputs: $ARGUMENTS is freeform steering (user intent, constraints, random notes). Process it intelligently.
Resolve DOC_PATH from $ARGUMENTS + the current conversation. If the doc is not obvious, ask the user to choose from the top 2–3 candidates.
Question policy (strict):

- You MUST answer anything discoverable from code/tests/fixtures/logs or by running repo tooling; do not ask me.
- Allowed questions only:
  - Product/UX decisions not encoded in repo/docs
  - External constraints not in repo/docs (policies, launch dates, KPIs, access)
  - Doc-path ambiguity (top 2-3 candidates)
  - Missing access/permissions
- If you think you need to ask, first state where you looked; ask only after exhausting repo evidence.

# COMMUNICATING WITH USERNAME (IMPORTANT)

- Start console output with a 1 line reminder of our North Star.
- Then give the punch line in plain English.
- Then give a short update in natural English (bullets optional; use them only if they improve clarity).
- Never be pedantic. Assume shorthand is intentional (long day); optimize for the real goal.
- Put deep details (commands, logs, exhaustive lists) in DOC_PATH / WORKLOG_PATH, not in console output.

Subagents (agent-assisted; parallel read-only sweeps when beneficial)
- Use subagents to keep grep-heavy scanning and long outputs out of the main agent context.
- Spawn these subagents in parallel only when they are read-only and disjoint.
- Subagent ground rules:
  - Read-only: subagents MUST NOT modify files or create artifacts.
  - Shared environment: avoid commands that generate/overwrite outputs; prefer pure read/search.
  - No questions: subagents must answer from repo/doc evidence only.
  - No recursion: subagents must NOT spawn other subagents.
  - Output must match the exact format requested (no extra narrative).
  - Do not spam/poll subagents; wait for completion, then integrate.
  - Close subagents once their results are captured.

Spawn subagents as needed (disjoint scopes; read-only):
1) Subagent: Call-Site Inventory + Grouping
   - Task: enumerate call sites that must change and group them into logical migration batches.
   - Output format (bullets only):
     - Group: <name>
       - <path> — <symbol> — <why>
2) Subagent: Deletes / Cleanup Inventory
   - Task: identify what must be deleted/removed to avoid parallel paths (old APIs, dead files, unused codepaths).
   - Output format (bullets only):
     - <path> — <what should be deleted/removed> — <why>
3) Subagent: Smallest Signal Checks
   - Task: identify the smallest existing checks (tests/typecheck/lint/build) relevant to each phase. Prefer programmatic checks; reserve UI automation for finalization unless explicitly required.
   - Output format (bullets only):
     - <phase candidate> — <command> — <signal>

Documentation-only (planning):
- This prompt is for documentation and planning only. DO NOT modify code.
- You may read code and run read-only searches to enumerate call sites and plan phases.
- If you discover missing work, add it to the phase plan (do not implement here).
- Do not commit/push unless explicitly requested in $ARGUMENTS.

Alignment check: North Star (keep it light)
- Concrete + scoped: state a clear claim and the smallest credible acceptance signal (prefer existing tests/checks; otherwise minimal instrumentation/log signature; otherwise a short manual checklist). Avoid inventing new harnesses/frameworks by default.
- Coherent: in-scope/out-of-scope does not contradict the TL;DR/plan.
If unclear or contradictory, pause and ask for a quick doc edit before proceeding.

Alignment check: UX scope (keep it light)
- The doc explicitly states UX in-scope and UX out-of-scope: what screens/states/behaviors change vs do NOT change.
- UX scope is coherent with the North Star and does not silently expand.
If unclear or contradictory, pause and ask for a quick doc edit before proceeding.

Warn-first preflight (recommended planning pass sequence; do NOT hard-block)
- Recommended flow before phase planning and implementation:
  1) Deep dive (pass 1): current/target architecture + call-site audit
  2) External research grounding (best practices where applicable)
  3) Deep dive (pass 2): integrate external research into target architecture + call-site audit
- Before writing the phase plan, check DOC_PATH for the planning passes marker:
  - `<!-- arch_skill:block:planning_passes:start -->` … `<!-- arch_skill:block:planning_passes:end -->`
  - If present: use it to determine which passes are done.
  - If missing: infer from doc contents (deep dive blocks / external research block), but treat deep dive pass 2 as unknown.
- If the recommended sequence is incomplete or unknown, DO NOT stop. Proceed to write the phase plan, but print a clear warning in the Summary (with the missing items and the recommended next prompts).

Write/update the phased plan block into DOC_PATH (anti-fragile: do NOT assume section numbers match the template).
Placement rule (in order):
1) If a block marker exists, replace the content inside it:
   - `<!-- arch_skill:block:phase_plan:start -->` … `<!-- arch_skill:block:phase_plan:end -->`
2) Else, if the doc already contains a section whose heading includes "Phase Plan" or "Phased Implementation" (case-insensitive), update it in place.
3) Else insert a new top-level phased plan section:
   - Prefer inserting after the Call-Site Audit / Change Inventory section if present,
   - otherwise after Target Architecture,
   - otherwise after Research/Problem sections.
Numbering rule:
- If the doc uses numbered headings ("# 7) ..."), preserve existing numbering; do not renumber the rest of the document.
Do not paste the full block to the console.

DOCUMENT INSERT FORMAT:
<!-- arch_skill:block:phase_plan:start -->
# Depth-First Phased Implementation Plan (authoritative)

> Rule: systematic build, foundational first; every phase has exit criteria + explicit verification plan (tests optional). Prefer programmatic checks per phase; defer manual/UI verification to finalization. Avoid negative-value tests (deletion checks, visual constants, doc-driven gates). Also: document new patterns/gotchas in code comments at the canonical boundary (high leverage, not comment spam).

## Phase 1 — <foundation>

* Goal:
* Work:
* Verification (smallest signal):
* Docs/comments (propagation; only if needed):
* Exit criteria:
* Rollback:

## Phase N — <end state + cleanup>

* Goal:
* Work:
* Verification (smallest signal):
* Docs/comments (propagation; only if needed):
* Exit criteria:
* Rollback:
<!-- arch_skill:block:phase_plan:end -->

OUTPUT FORMAT (console only; USERNAME-style):
This is the information it should contain but you should communicate it naturally in english not as a bulleted list that is hard to parse for the user.
Include:
- North Star reminder (1 line)
- Punchline (1 line)
- What you did / what changed
- Issues/Risks (if any)
- Next action
- Need from USERNAME (only if required)
- Pointers (DOC_PATH / WORKLOG_PATH / other artifacts)
