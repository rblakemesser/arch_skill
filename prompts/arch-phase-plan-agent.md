# /prompts:arch-phase-plan-agent — $ARGUMENTS
Execution rule: do not block on unrelated dirty files in git; ignore unrecognized changes. If committing, stage only files you touched (or as instructed).
Do not preface with a plan or restate these instructions. Begin work immediately. If a tool-call preamble is required by system policy, keep it to a single terse line with no step list. Console output must ONLY use the specified format; no extra narrative.
Inputs: $ARGUMENTS is freeform steering (user intent, constraints, random notes). Process it intelligently.
Resolve DOC_PATH from $ARGUMENTS + the current conversation. If the doc is not obvious, ask the user to choose from the top 2–3 candidates.
Question policy (strict):

- You MUST answer anything discoverable from code/tests/fixtures/logs or by running repo tooling; do not ask me.
- Allowed questions only:
  - Product/UX decisions not encoded in repo/docs
  - External constraints not in repo/docs (policies, launch dates, KPIs, access)
  - Doc-path ambiguity (top 2-3 candidates)
  - Missing access/permissions
- If you think you need to ask, first state where you looked; ask only after exhausting repo evidence.

Subagents (agent-assisted; parallel read-only sweeps when beneficial)
- Use subagents to keep grep-heavy scanning and long outputs out of the main agent context.
- Spawn these subagents in parallel only when they are read-only and disjoint.
- Subagent ground rules:
  - Read-only: subagents MUST NOT modify files or create artifacts.
  - Shared environment: avoid commands that generate/overwrite outputs; prefer pure read/search.
  - No questions: subagents must answer from repo/doc evidence only.
  - No recursion: subagents must NOT spawn other subagents.
  - Output must match the exact format requested (no extra narrative).
  - Do not spam/poll subagents; wait for completion, then integrate.
  - Close subagents once their results are captured.

Spawn subagents as needed (disjoint scopes; read-only):
1) Subagent: Call-Site Inventory + Grouping
   - Task: enumerate call sites that must change and group them into logical migration batches.
   - Output format (bullets only):
     - Group: <name>
       - <path> — <symbol> — <why>
2) Subagent: Deletes / Cleanup Inventory
   - Task: identify what must be deleted/removed to avoid parallel paths (old APIs, dead files, unused codepaths).
   - Output format (bullets only):
     - <path> — <what should be deleted/removed> — <why>
3) Subagent: Smallest Signal Checks
   - Task: identify the smallest existing checks (tests/typecheck/lint/build/QA automation) relevant to each phase.
   - Output format (bullets only):
     - <phase candidate> — <command> — <pass/fail signal>

Documentation-only (planning):
- This prompt is for documentation and planning only. DO NOT modify code.
- You may read code and run read-only searches to enumerate call sites and plan phases.
- If you discover missing work, add it to the phase plan (do not implement here).
- Do not commit/push unless explicitly requested in $ARGUMENTS.

Stop-the-line: North Star Gate (must pass before writing the phase plan)
- Falsifiable + verifiable: the North Star states a concrete claim AND the smallest credible pass/fail signal (prefer existing tests/checks; otherwise minimal instrumentation/log signature; otherwise a short manual checklist). Do NOT invent new harnesses/screenshot frameworks or drift scripts by default.
- Bounded + coherent: the North Star clearly states in-scope + out-of-scope and does not contradict the TL;DR/plan.
If the North Star Gate does not pass, STOP and ask the user to fix/confirm the North Star in the doc before proceeding.

Stop-the-line: UX Scope Gate (must pass before writing the phase plan)
- The doc explicitly states UX in-scope and UX out-of-scope: what screens/states/behaviors change vs do NOT change.
- UX scope is coherent with the North Star and does not silently expand.
If the UX Scope Gate does not pass, STOP and ask the user to fix/confirm scope in the doc before proceeding.

Write/update the phased plan block into DOC_PATH (anti-fragile: do NOT assume section numbers match the template).
Placement rule (in order):
1) If a block marker exists, replace the content inside it:
   - `<!-- arch_skill:block:phase_plan:start -->` … `<!-- arch_skill:block:phase_plan:end -->`
2) Else, if the doc already contains a section whose heading includes "Phase Plan" or "Phased Implementation" (case-insensitive), update it in place.
3) Else insert a new top-level phased plan section:
   - Prefer inserting after the Call-Site Audit / Change Inventory section if present,
   - otherwise after Target Architecture,
   - otherwise after Research/Problem sections.
Numbering rule:
- If the doc uses numbered headings ("# 7) ..."), preserve existing numbering; do not renumber the rest of the document.
Do not paste the full block to the console.

DOCUMENT INSERT FORMAT:
