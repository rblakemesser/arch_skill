Execution rule: do not block on unrelated dirty files in git; ignore unrecognized changes. If committing, stage only files you touched (or as instructed).
Fill the Research Grounding section in $DOC_PATH.
- External anchors: what to adopt vs reject.
- Internal ground truth: file paths + behaviors.

## 3.1 External anchors (papers, systems, prior art)
- <source> — <what we borrow / what we reject> — <why it applies>

## 3.2 Internal ground truth (code as spec)
- **Authoritative behavior anchors (do not reinvent):**

  - `<path>` — <pattern>

## 3.3 Open questions from research
- Q1:
- Q2:
