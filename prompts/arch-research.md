description: "03) Research grounding: external + internal anchors."
argument-hint: DOC_PATH=<path> (optional)
---
Execution rule: do not block on unrelated dirty files in git; ignore unrecognized changes. If committing, stage only files you touched (or as instructed).
Do not preface with a plan or restate these instructions. Begin work immediately. If a tool-call preamble is required by system policy, keep it to a single terse line with no step list. Console output must ONLY use the specified format; no extra narrative.
If DOC_PATH is not provided, locate the most relevant architecture doc by semantic match to $ARGUMENTS and the current conversation; prefer the doc that explicitly matches the topic and is most recently updated among relevant candidates. If you cannot determine a clear winner, ask the user to choose from the top 2–3 candidates.
Do not ask the user questions during investigation. Resolve by reading more code and searching the repo. Ask only if required information is not present in the repo or doc and cannot be inferred (e.g., product choice or external constraint).
Fill the Research Grounding section in $DOC_PATH.
- External anchors: what to adopt vs reject.
- Internal ground truth: file paths + behaviors.
- Open questions + evidence needed.
Write the Research Grounding block into $DOC_PATH (replace section 3 in-place). Do not paste the full block to the console.

DOCUMENT INSERT FORMAT (replace section 3 in-place):
# 3) Research Grounding (external + internal “ground truth”)
## 3.1 External anchors (papers, systems, prior art)
- <source> — <what we borrow / what we reject> — <why it applies>

## 3.2 Internal ground truth (code as spec)
- **Authoritative behavior anchors (do not reinvent):**
  - `<path>` — <what it defines>
- **Existing patterns we will reuse:**
  - `<path>` — <pattern>

## 3.3 Open questions from research
- Q1:
- Q2:
- What evidence would settle them:

CONSOLE OUTPUT FORMAT (summary + open questions only):
Summary:
- <bullet>
Open questions:
- <open question>
