# /prompts:arch-codereview — $ARGUMENTS
# COMMUNICATING WITH USERNAME (IMPORTANT)
- Start console output with a 1 line reminder of our North Star.
- Then give the punch line in plain English.
- Then give a short update in natural English (bullets optional; only if they help).
- Never be pedantic. Assume shorthand is intentional (long day); optimize for the real goal.
- Keep console output high-signal; long logs go in a file.

Execution rule: do not block on unrelated dirty files in git; ignore unrecognized changes. If committing, stage only files you touched (or as instructed).
Do not preface with a plan or restate these instructions. Begin work immediately.
$ARGUMENTS is freeform steering. Infer what you can.

Hard constraints:
- Detect which agent you're running in and use the OTHER tool for the review:
  - If `CLAUDECODE=1` is set (you are Claude Code): use Codex CLI
    `echo "<prompt>" | codex exec --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`
  - Otherwise (you are Codex or other): use Claude Code CLI
    `echo "<prompt>" | claude -p --dangerously-skip-permissions`
- NEVER pass the prompt as a positional argument — it hangs in nested sessions.
- ALWAYS use print/exec mode so the reviewer exits after responding.

Question policy (strict):
- You MUST answer anything discoverable from code/tests/docs or by running repo tooling; do not ask me.
- Allowed questions only:
  - Missing access/permissions (e.g., `claude` not installed / not authenticated)
  - Doc-path ambiguity (pick from top 2–3 candidates)
  - A real product/UX decision not encoded anywhere

Goal:
Get an external, high-signal code review of the implementation relative to the plan doc, then integrate the feedback you agree with (you do not have to accept everything).

## 0) Resolve DOC_PATH
- If $ARGUMENTS contains a `docs/<...>.md` path, use it as DOC_PATH.
- Otherwise infer DOC_PATH from the repo (recent docs, or the most relevant plan doc). If ambiguous, ask the user to choose from the top 2–3 candidates.

## 1) Run external review (this may take ~5 minutes — don't be antsy)
- Print one short line like: "Running external code review (can take ~5 minutes)…", then run the command and wait for completion (no chatty progress spam).
- CRITICAL: You must **pipe the prompt** to the reviewer, not pass it as a positional argument. Positional args hang when invoked from inside another agent session.
- Detect the reviewer CLI and run:
  ```bash
  # Detect reviewer CLI
  if [ "$$CLAUDECODE" = "1" ]; then
    REVIEWER="codex exec --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox"
  else
    REVIEWER="claude -p --dangerously-skip-permissions"
  fi

  cat <<'REVIEW_EOF' | $$REVIEWER
  <PROMPT>
  REVIEW_EOF
  ```

Where `<PROMPT>` is a single, well-formed instruction that includes DOC_PATH and asks for actionable, evidence-anchored feedback.
Use this prompt template (fill in DOC_PATH and any scope hints from $ARGUMENTS):

Claude prompt:
`Code review my implementation relative to DOC_PATH=<DOC_PATH>. Read the relevant files and the diff vs main, and find anything we did we weren't supposed to as well as anything we did not do that we were supposed to. DO NOT AUDIT FOR SECURITY OR PII CONCERNS THAT IS OUT OF SCOPE. Also: do not recommend negative-value tests (deleted-code proofs, visual-constant/golden noise, doc-driven inventory gates, mock-only interaction tests). Also: explicitly call out any runtime fallbacks/compatibility shims/placeholder behavior/silent error swallowing or defaulting that could mask incorrect behavior. Also: call out any missing high-leverage code comments/doc comments for new SSOTs/contracts or tricky gotchas; avoid comment spam. Review for correctness vs the plan, edge cases, performance, maintainability, and test coverage. Point to concrete evidence (file paths / symbols). Output: (1) Top risks (ranked), (2) Specific suggested fixes with file anchors, (3) Tests to add or run (relevant only, not full-suite), (4) Anything that looks over-scoped. Be direct.`

## 2) Process feedback (apply what we agree with)
- Summarize Claude’s feedback into three buckets:
  - “Will do now” (high-confidence, in-scope)
  - “Disagree / won’t do” (with a short rationale)
  - “Follow-ups” (good ideas but out-of-scope for this PR)
- For “Will do now” items: implement fixes and keep changes minimal/targeted.
- Re-validate only if you changed executable/build-affecting code in response to the review.
  - Prefer one targeted check tied to the accepted feedback.
  - If you made no code changes or only changed docs/comments, skip reruns.
- If the plan doc needs a quick update (Decision Log / risks), update DOC_PATH accordingly (keep it short).

Commit policy:
- Do NOT commit by default; leave changes ready for `/prompts:arch-open-pr`.
- If $ARGUMENTS explicitly asks to commit, do so (stage only files you touched).

OUTPUT FORMAT (console only; USERNAME-style):
This is the information it should contain but you should communicate it naturally in english not as a bulleted list that is hard to parse for the user.
Include:
- North Star reminder (1 line)
- Punchline (1 line)
- What the reviewer found (short, practical summary)
- What you accepted vs declined (and why, briefly)
- What you changed (if anything) + what checks you ran
- Pointers (DOC_PATH + any file where you saved the raw Claude output, if you saved it)
