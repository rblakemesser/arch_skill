# /prompts:arch-plan-audit — $ARGUMENTS
Execution rule: ignore unrelated dirty git files; if committing, stage only what you touched.
Do not preface with a plan. Begin work immediately.

Goal:
Audit a plan doc against the planning phases and tell me what’s “done / good” vs what’s not there yet.
This is NOT a checkbox exercise; it should reflect the highest standard: best-possible architecture, fully specified, fully idiomatic, drift-proof, and call-site complete.

Inputs:
- $ARGUMENTS is freeform steering. Treat it as intent + constraints + any relevant context.

DOC_PATH:
- If $ARGUMENTS includes a docs/<...>.md path, use it.
- Otherwise infer from the conversation.
- If ambiguous, ask me to pick from the top 2–3 candidates.

Question policy (strict: no dumb questions):
- Do NOT ask technical questions you can answer by reading the plan/code/tests. Go look and decide.
- Ask only when you need a product/UX scope decision, or DOC_PATH is ambiguous.

Hard rules:
- Do not modify any files; output only.
- Code is ground truth: you may (and should) read code + use `rg` to validate “call sites audited” claims.

How to score phases:
- PASS = genuinely complete and implementation-ready.
- PARTIAL = present but missing key specifics / not enforceable yet.
- FAIL = missing or too vague to implement safely.
- SKIP = optional for this plan (say why).

What MUST be emphasized (the “big 3”):
1) Target architecture is FULLY specified (not vibes):
   - SSOT is explicit, boundaries are enforceable, contracts/APIs are concrete, migration + delete list prevent parallel paths.
2) Architecture is FULLY idiomatic:
   - Reuses existing repo patterns, avoids inventing new frameworks/abstractions unless clearly necessary.
3) Call sites are AUDITED (exhaustive):
   - Plan enumerates affected call sites; verify by searching the repo for additional call sites and flag any misses.

Minimum audit procedure:
1) Read DOC_PATH fully.
2) Identify the sections (or nearest equivalents) for:
   - North Star + UX scope
   - Research grounding
   - Current architecture (as-is)
   - Target architecture (to-be)
   - Call-site audit / change inventory
   - Phase plan
   - (optional) DevX targets
   - (optional) Review gate
3) Call-site validation:
   - Extract 2–5 key symbols/files from the plan’s target APIs or call-site table.
   - Use `rg` to find call sites in the repo.
   - If you find plausible call sites not represented in the plan, mark Call‑Site Audit as FAIL and list the misses.

OUTPUT FORMAT (console only; match this structure):
Summary:
- Doc: <path>
- Verdict: <ready to implement|not ready> (<one short reason>)

Phase audit:
- North Star — <PASS|PARTIAL|FAIL>
  - <1–2 short bullets>
- Research Grounding — <PASS|PARTIAL|FAIL>
  - <1–2 short bullets>
- Current Architecture (as-is) — <PASS|PARTIAL|FAIL>
  - <1–2 short bullets>
- Target Architecture (to-be) — <PASS|PARTIAL|FAIL> (FULLY specified?)
  - <1–3 short bullets>
- Call‑Site Audit — <PASS|PARTIAL|FAIL> (CALL SITES AUDITED?)
  - <1–3 short bullets>
- Phase Plan — <PASS|PARTIAL|FAIL>
  - <1–2 short bullets>
- DevX Targets — <PASS|PARTIAL|FAIL|SKIP>
  - <1 short bullet>
- Review Gate — <PASS|PARTIAL|FAIL|SKIP>
  - <1 short bullet>

Critical gaps (blockers):
- Fully specified target architecture:
  - <bullets>
- Fully audited call sites:
  - <bullets>
- Fully idiomatic / drift-proof:
  - <bullets>

Next:
- <the single best next prompt to run + why> (e.g. `/prompts:arch-deep-dive`, `/prompts:arch-plan-enhance`, `/prompts:arch-phase-plan`)
Open questions (ONLY scope/product, if any):
- <question>
