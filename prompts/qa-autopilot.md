# /prompts:qa-autopilot — $ARGUMENTS
Execution rule: ignore unrelated dirty git files; if committing, stage only what you touched.
Do not preface with a plan. Begin work immediately.

Goal:
Use QA automation to confirm the fundamentals first, then expand coverage. Stay fast and systematic.
If QA automation is broken or missing coverage, fix it in an architecturally elegant / idiomatic / unified way that prevents drift, then rerun and record results.

Important (what this prompt is / is not):
- This prompt is for QA automation (end-to-end / integration / UI smoke tests that exercise a running app on sim/emulator/device).
- This is NOT a “run unit tests” prompt. Do not default to `*_test` / `unit test` suites as your primary signal.

Context:
$ARGUMENTS is freeform steering. Treat it as intent + constraints + any relevant context from the session.

DOC_PATH (optional plan doc):
- If $ARGUMENTS includes a docs/<...>.md path, use it as DOC_PATH.
- Otherwise infer from the conversation.
- If no plan doc exists, proceed plan-less (this prompt still runs).

QA worklog doc (authoritative for this run):
- If DOC_PATH is known: create/use `docs/<DOC_BASENAME>_QA_WORKLOG.md`.
- Otherwise create a new doc in `docs/`:
  - `docs/QA_AUTOPILOT_<TITLE_SCREAMING_SNAKE>_<DATE>.md`
  - TITLE_SCREAMING_SNAKE = derived from $ARGUMENTS in 5–9 words.
  - DATE = today's date in YYYY-MM-DD.

Question policy (strict: no dumb questions):

- You MUST answer anything discoverable from code/tests/fixtures/logs or by running repo tooling; do not ask me.
- Allowed questions only:
  - Product/UX decisions not encoded in repo/docs
  - External constraints not in repo/docs (policies, launch dates, KPIs, access)
  - Doc-path ambiguity (top 2-3 candidates)
  - Missing access/permissions
- If you think you need to ask, first state where you looked; ask only after exhausting repo evidence.


# COMMUNICATING WITH USERNAME (IMPORTANT)

- Start console output with a 1 line reminder of our North Star.
- Then give the punch line in plain English.
- Then give a short update in natural English (bullets optional; use them only if they improve clarity).
- Never be pedantic. Assume shorthand is intentional (long day); optimize for the real goal.
- Put deep details (commands, logs, exhaustive lists) in DOC_PATH / WORKLOG_PATH, not in console output.

Autonomy policy (this is autopilot):
- Do NOT stop to “check in”, narrate progress, or ask “what next”.
- Use the QA worklog doc as your running transcript. Keep executing until you hit a real Stop condition or you’re genuinely done.
- Only print a console summary when you are about to STOP (complete / blocked / timeboxed).

End-to-end execution (no mid-flight stopping):
- Run the fundamental behaviors checklist end-to-end in one uninterrupted session.
- Treat each checklist item as an internal step: run → fix/unblock if needed → record → continue.
- Do NOT stop after a successful run to tell the user “Next: …”. Keep going until you reach a Stop condition.

Operating principles:
- Start with fundamentals: the smallest, highest-signal smoke tests first.
- Prefer existing QA harnesses. Do not invent new frameworks if one already exists.
- If multiple harnesses exist, choose the fastest/most reliable one to validate the North Star / core UX surfaces.
- QA fixes must be unified + drift-proof:
  - Prefer reusable subflows/helpers over copy/paste tests.
  - Centralize selectors/ids/helpers where the project’s idioms suggest.
  - Avoid parallel ways to test the same thing.
- High-signal checks only:
  - Do NOT add “proof” tests that assert visual constants (colors/margins/pixels) or try to build a golden/pixel baseline pipeline.
  - Avoid brittle selectors: do not select by pixel coordinates; prefer stable ids/labels/semantics already used by the repo.
  - Avoid flake: prefer waiting on real conditions over arbitrary sleeps/delays.

Stop conditions:
- If you discover a product-level issue that requires a decision: STOP and report (no guessing).
- If QA is impossible due to infra/environment issues: STOP and report the single smallest unblock step.

Unblock policy (default: fix it, don’t ask):
- Do NOT get stuck on obvious compile/build/QA-harness failures. Treat them as part of the work.
- If a run fails due to compilation, typecheck, lint-as-error, missing imports, etc.:
  - Note it in the QA worklog doc (briefly).
  - Fix it immediately (small, local, high-confidence fix).
  - Re-run the smallest relevant QA signal.
- Only stop for “infra/environment” when you truly cannot unblock from repo code (e.g., missing SDKs/credentials/CI-only resources). Even then, propose the single smallest unblock step.
- “Obvious bug” rule: if you can clearly see the bug and the fix is small + high-confidence, note it and fix it (don’t debate it).

Environment preflight (fast; do early; don't repeat needlessly):
- If this is the first time you’re running QA in this repo/session (or you’re unsure), do a quick preflight BEFORE running tests:
  - Ensure the app is built from the latest code and installed on the target simulator/emulator/device.
  - Ensure the app can actually launch and reach any required dev servers/backends.
  - Check that required servers are up (packager/dev server, backend, mocks). Prefer a health check / curl / open-port check over guesswork.
- If you already verified preflight earlier in the same session and nothing changed, skip re-doing it—just note “preflight already verified”.

Process (systematic):
1) Grounding:
   - If DOC_PATH exists, read it and extract: North Star, UX in-scope/out-of-scope, any acceptance evidence expectations, and any known risky surfaces.
   - Determine the minimal “fundamental behaviors” to validate first (core flows, not edge cases).
   - Write these as a short checklist in the QA worklog doc. This checklist is your autopilot runlist.
   - If the app has multiple top-level navigation roots (tabs/routes/modes), include each as a checklist item (e.g., each tab should have at least one smoke validation).
2) Preflight (only if needed):
   - Verify app + server readiness using the “Environment preflight” rules above.
   - Record what you checked in the QA worklog doc (briefly).
3) Choose QA harness:
   - Detect existing automation tooling in the repo (e.g., existing e2e folders, scripts, CI targets).
   - Prefer the canonical entrypoint (Makefile target / package.json script / documented command).
4) Smoke first:
   - Run the smallest, fastest smoke(s) that validate the fundamental behaviors.
   - Record command + result in the QA worklog doc.
5) Expand coverage:
   - Add or run the next most fundamental tests (still high-signal).
   - Keep going until your “fundamental behaviors” checklist is satisfied (or explicitly marked unverified with a reason).
6) If automation is broken / missing coverage:
   - Create/extend a section in the QA worklog doc:
     - "Automation Gaps (blocking)" — what’s broken and why it blocks signal
     - "Unified Fix (idiomatic)" — the single clean way to solve it without drift
   - Implement the fix (tests/flows/helpers) using existing repo idioms.
   - Re-run the smallest relevant test and record the new result.
7) If a failure is a real product bug (not test flake):
   - Create a "Product Bugs Found" section with crisp repro steps + evidence.
   - If the fix requires a product decision, STOP and ask (with context).
   - If it does NOT require a product decision, you may fix it if it is clearly in-scope of the plan (otherwise record and stop).
8) If a failure is a build/compile/test-harness failure:
   - Follow “Unblock policy” above: note → fix → re-run smallest signal.
   - Prefer the smallest fix that restores the canonical QA entrypoint and avoids drift.
9) Stop only when one of these is true:
   - COMPLETE: the fundamental behaviors checklist is satisfied and confidence is high/certain.
   - BLOCKED: a Stop condition was hit (product decision or true infra/environment blocker).
   - TIMEBOXED: you’ve spent a reasonable amount of wall clock time (default ~30–45 min) and remaining work is lower-signal; record what’s unverified and why.
