description: "05) UI ASCII: current-target mockups (if UI)."
argument-hint: "<Freeform guidance. Include a docs/<...>.md path anywhere to pin the plan doc (optional).>"
---
Execution rule: do not block on unrelated dirty files in git; ignore unrecognized changes. If committing, stage only files you touched (or as instructed).
Do not preface with a plan or restate these instructions. Begin work immediately. If a tool-call preamble is required by system policy, keep it to a single terse line with no step list. Console output must ONLY use the specified format; no extra narrative.
Inputs: $ARGUMENTS is freeform steering (user intent, constraints, random notes). Process it intelligently.
Resolve DOC_PATH from $ARGUMENTS + the current conversation. If the doc is not obvious, ask the user to choose from the top 2–3 candidates.
Question policy (strict):
- Do NOT ask the user technical questions you can answer by reading code or the plan doc; go look and decide.
- Ask the user only for true product decisions / external constraints not present in the repo/doc, or to disambiguate between multiple equally plausible docs.
- If multiple viable technical approaches exist, pick the most idiomatic default and note alternatives in the doc (do not ask “what do you want to do?”).

Stop-the-line gates (must pass before adding UI ASCII)
- North Star Gate: falsifiable + verifiable, bounded + coherent.
- UX Scope Gate: explicit UX in-scope/out-of-scope (what users see changes vs does not change).
If either gate does not pass, STOP and ask the user to fix/confirm in the doc before proceeding.
If the change touches UI/UX, add ASCII mockups for current and target states in DOC_PATH.
Keep them contract-level, not illustrative.
Write/update the ASCII blocks into DOC_PATH (anti-fragile: do NOT assume section numbers match the template).
Placement rule (in order):
1) If marker blocks exist, replace content inside them:
   - `<!-- arch_skill:block:ui_ascii_current:start -->` … `<!-- arch_skill:block:ui_ascii_current:end -->`
   - `<!-- arch_skill:block:ui_ascii_target:start -->` … `<!-- arch_skill:block:ui_ascii_target:end -->`
2) Else, if the doc has "Current Architecture"/"As-is" and "Target Architecture"/"To-be" sections, add a `## UI surfaces (ASCII)` subsection under each (or update it if it exists).
3) Else, append a standalone `# UI Surfaces (ASCII)` section near the architecture content with both blocks.
Do not paste the full blocks to the console.

DOCUMENT INSERT FORMAT (use wherever it fits best per the rules above):
<!-- arch_skill:block:ui_ascii_current:start -->
Current UI ASCII:
```ascii
<ASCII mockups for current UI states>
```
<!-- arch_skill:block:ui_ascii_current:end -->

<!-- arch_skill:block:ui_ascii_target:start -->
Target UI ASCII:
```ascii
<ASCII mockups for target UI states>
```
<!-- arch_skill:block:ui_ascii_target:end -->

CONSOLE OUTPUT FORMAT (summary + open questions only):
Summary:
- <bullet>
Open questions:
- <open question>
