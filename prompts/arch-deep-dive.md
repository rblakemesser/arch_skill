# /prompts:arch-deep-dive — $ARGUMENTS
Execution rule: do not block on unrelated dirty files in git; ignore unrecognized changes. If committing, stage only files you touched (or as instructed).
Do not preface with a plan or restate these instructions. Begin work immediately. If a tool-call preamble is required by system policy, keep it to a single terse line with no step list. Console output must ONLY use the specified format; no extra narrative.
Inputs: $ARGUMENTS is freeform steering (user intent, constraints, random notes). Process it intelligently.
Resolve DOC_PATH from $ARGUMENTS + the current conversation. If the doc is not obvious, ask the user to choose from the top 2–3 candidates.
Question policy (strict):
- Do NOT ask the user technical questions you can answer by reading code or the plan doc; go look and decide.
- Ask the user only for true product decisions / external constraints not present in the repo/doc, or to disambiguate between multiple equally plausible docs.
- If multiple viable technical approaches exist, pick the most idiomatic default and note alternatives in the doc (do not ask “what do you want to do?”).
Do not ask the user questions during investigation. Resolve by reading more code and searching the repo. Ask only if required by a stop-the-line gate or if required information is not present in the repo/doc and cannot be inferred.

Documentation-only (planning):
- This prompt is for documentation and planning only. DO NOT modify code.
- You may read code and run read-only searches to ground the architecture and call-site audit.
- If you discover code changes we likely need, capture them in DOC_PATH (call-site audit + phase plan), with file anchors (do not implement them here).
- Do not commit/push unless explicitly requested in $ARGUMENTS.

Stop-the-line: North Star Gate (must pass before current/target architecture + call-site audit)
- Falsifiable + verifiable: the North Star states a concrete claim AND how we will prove it (acceptance evidence: tests/harness/instrumentation/manual QA + stop-the-line invariants).
- Bounded + coherent: the North Star clearly states in-scope + out-of-scope and does not contradict the TL;DR/plan.
If the North Star Gate does not pass, STOP and ask the user to fix/confirm the North Star in the doc before proceeding.

Stop-the-line: UX Scope Gate (must pass before current/target architecture + call-site audit)
- The doc explicitly states UX in-scope and UX out-of-scope: what screens/states/behaviors change vs do NOT change.
- UX scope is coherent with the North Star and does not silently expand.
If the UX Scope Gate does not pass, STOP and ask the user to fix/confirm scope in the doc before proceeding.

You are designing architecture. Produce/update THREE artifacts in DOC_PATH:
1) Current architecture (as-is): on-disk tree, 2–4 primary control paths, ownership boundaries, failure behavior.
2) Target architecture (to-be): future tree, future flows, explicit new/changed contracts, invariants/boundaries.
3) Call-site audit: exhaustive inventory of what changes where (and why), grounded in code.

Hard rules (drift-proof):
- Code is ground truth: every claim is anchored in file paths (include symbols when helpful).
- No competing sources of truth: prefer centralized contracts/primitives; delete/avoid parallel implementations.
- Do not ask the user technical questions you can answer by reading code; go look and decide.
- If multiple viable technical approaches exist, pick the most idiomatic default and note alternatives in the doc (do not ask “what do you want to do?”).

Pattern Consolidation Sweep (anti-blinders; scoped by the plan)
- If this design introduces/updates a central pattern (SSOT, lifecycle primitive, layout contract, policy resolver, etc.), look for other places that should adopt it.
- Capture candidates with file paths and your default recommendation: include in this plan vs defer (follow-up) vs exclude.
- Treat the plan’s scope as authoritative. Do NOT ask the user to re-decide scope here.
  - If a candidate is in-scope: mark it include and proceed.
  - If it expands scope: default to defer/exclude (and proceed). Do not block.
  - Only stop+ask if the plan’s scope/North Star is internally contradictory (i.e., required work is declared out-of-scope).

DOC UPDATE RULES (anti-fragile; do NOT assume section numbers match the template)
Placement rule (in order):
1) If block markers exist, replace the content inside them:
   - `<!-- arch_skill:block:current_architecture:start -->` … `<!-- arch_skill:block:current_architecture:end -->`
   - `<!-- arch_skill:block:target_architecture:start -->` … `<!-- arch_skill:block:target_architecture:end -->`
   - `<!-- arch_skill:block:call_site_audit:start -->` … `<!-- arch_skill:block:call_site_audit:end -->`
2) Else, update in place if semantically matching headings exist (case-insensitive match):
   - Current: "Current Architecture", "As-is"
   - Target: "Target Architecture", "To-be"
   - Audit: "Call-Site Audit", "Change map", "Change inventory"
3) Else, insert missing top-level sections:
   - Prefer inserting after research/problem sections,
   - and before phased plan / test strategy / rollout sections.
Numbering rule:
- If the doc uses numbered headings ("# 4) ..."), preserve existing numbering; do not renumber the rest of the document.
Do not paste the full inserted blocks to the console.
