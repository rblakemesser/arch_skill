# /prompts:arch-deep-dive — $ARGUMENTS
Execution rule: do not block on unrelated dirty files in git; ignore unrecognized changes. If committing, stage only files you touched (or as instructed).
Do not preface with a plan or restate these instructions. Begin work immediately. If a tool-call preamble is required by system policy, keep it to a single terse line with no step list. Console output should be short and high-signal (no logs); see OUTPUT FORMAT for required content.
Inputs: $ARGUMENTS is freeform steering (user intent, constraints, random notes). Process it intelligently.
Resolve DOC_PATH from $ARGUMENTS + the current conversation. If the doc is not obvious, ask the user to choose from the top 2–3 candidates.
Question policy (strict):

- You MUST answer anything discoverable from code/tests/fixtures/logs or by running repo tooling; do not ask me.
- Allowed questions only:
  - Product/UX decisions not encoded in repo/docs
  - External constraints not in repo/docs (policies, launch dates, KPIs, access)
  - Doc-path ambiguity (top 2-3 candidates)
  - Missing access/permissions
- If you think you need to ask, first state where you looked; ask only after exhausting repo evidence.


# COMMUNICATING WITH USERNAME (IMPORTANT)

- Start console output with a 1 line reminder of our North Star.
- Then give the punch line in plain English.
- Then give a short update in natural English (bullets optional; use them only if they improve clarity).
- Never be pedantic. Assume shorthand is intentional (long day); optimize for the real goal.
- Put deep details (commands, logs, exhaustive lists) in DOC_PATH / WORKLOG_PATH, not in console output.

Documentation-only (planning):
- This prompt is for documentation and planning only. DO NOT modify code.
- You may read code and run read-only searches to ground the architecture and call-site audit.
- If you discover code changes we likely need, capture them in DOC_PATH (call-site audit + phase plan), with file anchors (do not implement them here).
- Do not commit/push unless explicitly requested in $ARGUMENTS.

Alignment check: North Star (keep it light)
- Concrete + scoped: state a clear claim and the smallest credible acceptance signal (prefer existing tests/checks; otherwise minimal instrumentation/log signature; otherwise a short manual checklist). Avoid inventing new harnesses/frameworks by default.
- Coherent: in-scope/out-of-scope does not contradict the TL;DR/plan.
If unclear or contradictory, pause and ask for a quick doc edit before proceeding.

Alignment check: UX scope (keep it light)
- The doc explicitly states UX in-scope and UX out-of-scope: what screens/states/behaviors change vs do NOT change.
- UX scope is coherent with the North Star and does not silently expand.
If unclear or contradictory, pause and ask for a quick doc edit before proceeding.

Warn-first planning passes (soft sequencing guard; do NOT hard-block)
- If DOC_PATH contains `<!-- arch_skill:block:planning_passes:start -->` … `<!-- arch_skill:block:planning_passes:end -->`, keep it updated.
- If missing, insert a new planning passes block near the top of the doc:
  - Prefer inserting after the TL;DR section if present,
  - otherwise after YAML front matter,
  - otherwise at the top of the document.
- Planning passes block format (use exactly this shape; update fields in-place):
  - `<!-- arch_skill:block:planning_passes:start -->`
  - `<!--`
  - `arch_skill:planning_passes`
  - `deep_dive_pass_1: <not started|done YYYY-MM-DD>`
  - `external_research_grounding: <not started|done YYYY-MM-DD>`
  - `deep_dive_pass_2: <not started|done YYYY-MM-DD>`
  - `recommended_flow: deep dive -> external research grounding -> deep dive again -> phase plan -> implement`
  - `-->`
  - `<!-- arch_skill:block:planning_passes:end -->`
- Update rules (additive; never wipe progress):
  - If external research grounding exists in DOC_PATH (block marker or an "External Research" section), set:
    - `deep_dive_pass_2: done <YYYY-MM-DD>`
  - Else set:
    - `deep_dive_pass_1: done <YYYY-MM-DD>`
  - Do NOT clear other fields (especially `external_research_grounding`).
  - Preserve any existing timestamps if present; update only the field(s) you are completing now.

You are designing architecture. Produce/update THREE artifacts in DOC_PATH:
1) Current architecture (as-is): on-disk tree, 2–4 primary control paths, ownership boundaries, failure behavior.
2) Target architecture (to-be): future tree, future flows, explicit new/changed contracts, invariants/boundaries.
3) Call-site audit: exhaustive inventory of what changes where (and why), grounded in code.

Hard rules (drift-proof):
- Code is ground truth: every claim is anchored in file paths (include symbols when helpful).
- No competing sources of truth: prefer centralized contracts/primitives; delete/avoid parallel implementations.
- Do not ask the user technical questions you can answer by reading code; go look and decide.
- If multiple viable technical approaches exist, pick the most idiomatic default and note alternatives in the doc (do not ask “what do you want to do?”).

Pattern Consolidation Sweep (anti-blinders; scoped by the plan)
- If this design introduces/updates a central pattern (SSOT, lifecycle primitive, layout contract, policy resolver, etc.), look for other places that should adopt it.
- Capture candidates with file paths and your default recommendation: include in this plan vs defer (follow-up) vs exclude.
- Treat the plan’s scope as authoritative. Do NOT ask the user to re-decide scope here.
  - If a candidate is in-scope: mark it include and proceed.
  - If it expands scope: default to defer/exclude (and proceed). Do not block.
  - Only stop+ask if the plan’s scope/North Star is internally contradictory (i.e., required work is declared out-of-scope).

DOC UPDATE RULES (anti-fragile; do NOT assume section numbers match the template)
Placement rule (in order):
1) If block markers exist, replace the content inside them:
   - `<!-- arch_skill:block:current_architecture:start -->` … `<!-- arch_skill:block:current_architecture:end -->`
   - `<!-- arch_skill:block:target_architecture:start -->` … `<!-- arch_skill:block:target_architecture:end -->`
   - `<!-- arch_skill:block:call_site_audit:start -->` … `<!-- arch_skill:block:call_site_audit:end -->`
2) Else, update in place if semantically matching headings exist (case-insensitive match):
   - Current: "Current Architecture", "As-is"
   - Target: "Target Architecture", "To-be"
   - Audit: "Call-Site Audit", "Change map", "Change inventory"
3) Else, insert missing top-level sections:
   - Prefer inserting after research/problem sections,
   - and before phased plan / test strategy / rollout sections.
Numbering rule:
- If the doc uses numbered headings ("# 4) ..."), preserve existing numbering; do not renumber the rest of the document.
Do not paste the full inserted blocks to the console.

OUTPUT FORMAT (console only; USERNAME-style):
This is the information it should contain but you should communicate it naturally in english not as a bulleted list that is hard to parse for the user.
Include:
- North Star reminder (1 line)
- Punchline (1 line)
- What you did / what changed
- Issues/Risks (if any)
- Next action
- Need from USERNAME (only if required)
- Pointers (DOC_PATH / WORKLOG_PATH / other artifacts)
