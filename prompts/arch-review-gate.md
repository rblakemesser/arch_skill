# /prompts:arch-review-gate — $ARGUMENTS
Execution rule: do not block on unrelated dirty files in git; ignore unrecognized changes. If committing, stage only files you touched (or as instructed).
Do not preface with a plan or restate these instructions. Begin work immediately. If a tool-call preamble is required by system policy, keep it to a single terse line with no step list. Console output must ONLY use the specified format; no extra narrative.
Inputs: $ARGUMENTS is freeform steering (user intent, constraints, random notes). Process it intelligently.
Resolve DOC_PATH from $ARGUMENTS + the current conversation. If the doc is not obvious, ask the user to choose from the top 2–3 candidates.
Question policy (strict):
- Do NOT ask the user technical questions you can answer by reading code or the plan doc; go look and decide.
- Ask the user only for true product decisions / external constraints not present in the repo/doc, or to disambiguate between multiple equally plausible docs.
- If multiple viable technical approaches exist, pick the most idiomatic default and note alternatives in the doc (do not ask “what do you want to do?”).

Documentation-only (planning):
- This prompt is for documentation and planning only. DO NOT modify code.
- You may read code to answer reviewer questions and ground dispositions.
- Integrate reviewer feedback by updating DOC_PATH (not by changing implementation here).
- Do not commit/push unless explicitly requested in $ARGUMENTS.

Stop-the-line gates (must pass before requesting external review)
- North Star Gate: falsifiable + verifiable, bounded + coherent.
- UX Scope Gate: explicit UX in-scope/out-of-scope (what users see changes vs does not change).
If either gate does not pass, STOP and ask the user to fix/confirm in the doc before proceeding.
Request reviews from opus/gemini with the explicit question:
“Is this idiomatic and complete relative to the plan?”
Provide any files they request. Integrate feedback you agree with.
Update DOC_PATH before moving to the next phase.
Write/update the Review Gate block into DOC_PATH (anti-fragile placement).
Placement rule (in order):
1) If a block marker exists, replace the content inside it:
   - `<!-- arch_skill:block:review_gate:start -->` … `<!-- arch_skill:block:review_gate:end -->`
2) Else, if a "Review Gate" section exists (heading match), update it in place.
3) Else append near the end of the plan doc (before Decision Log if present, otherwise append).
Do not paste the full block to the console.
