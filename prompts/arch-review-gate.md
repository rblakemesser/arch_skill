description: Request external review for completeness/idiomatic fit.
argument-hint: DOC_PATH=<path>

Execution rule: do not block on unrelated dirty files in git; ignore unrecognized changes. If committing, stage only files you touched (or as instructed).
Do not preface with a plan or restate these instructions. Begin work immediately. If a tool-call preamble is required by system policy, keep it to a single terse line with no step list. Console output must ONLY use the specified format; no extra narrative.
Request reviews from opus/gemini with the explicit question:
“Is this idiomatic and complete relative to the plan?”
Provide any files they request. Integrate feedback you agree with.
Update $DOC_PATH before moving to the next phase.
Write the Review Gate block into $DOC_PATH (append near the phase progress section). Do not paste the full block to the console.
