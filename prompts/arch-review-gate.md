# /prompts:arch-review-gate — $ARGUMENTS
Execution rule: do not block on unrelated dirty files in git; ignore unrecognized changes. If committing, stage only files you touched (or as instructed).
Do not preface with a plan or restate these instructions. Begin work immediately. If a tool-call preamble is required by system policy, keep it to a single terse line with no step list. Console output must ONLY use the specified format; no extra narrative.
Inputs: $ARGUMENTS is freeform steering (user intent, constraints, random notes). Process it intelligently.
Resolve DOC_PATH from $ARGUMENTS + the current conversation. If the doc is not obvious, ask the user to choose from the top 2–3 candidates.
Question policy (strict):

- You MUST answer anything discoverable from code/tests/fixtures/logs or by running repo tooling; do not ask me.
- Allowed questions only:
  - Product/UX decisions not encoded in repo/docs
  - External constraints not in repo/docs (policies, launch dates, KPIs, access)
  - Doc-path ambiguity (top 2-3 candidates)
  - Missing access/permissions
- If you think you need to ask, first state where you looked; ask only after exhausting repo evidence.


Documentation-only (planning):
- This prompt is for documentation and planning only. DO NOT modify code.
- You may read code to answer reviewer questions and ground dispositions.
- Integrate reviewer feedback by updating DOC_PATH (not by changing implementation here).
- Do not commit/push unless explicitly requested in $ARGUMENTS.

Stop-the-line gates (must pass before requesting external review)
- North Star Gate: falsifiable + verifiable, bounded + coherent.
- UX Scope Gate: explicit UX in-scope/out-of-scope (what users see changes vs does not change).
If either gate does not pass, STOP and ask the user to fix/confirm in the doc before proceeding.
Request reviews from opus/gemini with the explicit question:
“Is this idiomatic and complete relative to the plan?”
Provide any files they request. Integrate feedback you agree with.
Update DOC_PATH before moving to the next phase.
Write/update the Review Gate block into DOC_PATH (anti-fragile placement).
Placement rule (in order):
1) If a block marker exists, replace the content inside it:
   - `<!-- arch_skill:block:review_gate:start -->` … `<!-- arch_skill:block:review_gate:end -->`
2) Else, if a "Review Gate" section exists (heading match), update it in place.
3) Else append near the end of the plan doc (before Decision Log if present, otherwise append).
Do not paste the full block to the console.
