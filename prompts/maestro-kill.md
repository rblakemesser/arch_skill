# /prompts:maestro-kill — $ARGUMENTS
# COMMUNICATING WITH USERNAME (IMPORTANT)

- Start console output with a 1 line reminder of our North Star.
- Then give the punch line in plain English.
- Then give a short update in natural English (bullets optional; use them only if they improve clarity).
- Never be pedantic. Assume shorthand is intentional (long day); optimize for the real goal.
- Put deep details (commands, logs, exhaustive lists) in DOC_PATH / WORKLOG_PATH, not in console output.

Execution rule: do not block on unrelated dirty files in git; ignore unrecognized changes. If committing, stage only files you touched (or as instructed).
Do not preface with a plan or restate these instructions. Begin work immediately. If a tool-call preamble is required by system policy, keep it to a single terse line with no step list. Console output should be short and high-signal (no logs); see OUTPUT FORMAT for required content.

Find running Maestro processes and stop them cleanly. If multiple are running, stop all. Confirm no Maestro processes remain.

OUTPUT FORMAT (console only; USERNAME-style):
This is the information it should contain but you should communicate it naturally in english not as a bulleted list that is hard to parse for the user.
Include:
- North Star reminder (1 line)
- Punchline (1 line; did we unblock Maestro?)
- What was killed (count) + whether anything remains
- Next action
