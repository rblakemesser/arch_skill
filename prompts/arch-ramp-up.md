# /prompts:arch-ramp-up — $ARGUMENTS
Execution rule: do not block on unrelated dirty files in git; ignore unrecognized changes. If committing, stage only files you touched (or as instructed).
Do not preface with a plan or restate these instructions. Begin work immediately. If a tool-call preamble is required by system policy, keep it to a single terse line with no step list. Console output must ONLY use the specified format; no extra narrative.
Inputs: $ARGUMENTS is freeform steering (user intent, constraints, random notes). Process it intelligently.
Resolve DOC_PATH from $ARGUMENTS + the current conversation. If the doc is not obvious, ask the user to choose from the top 2–3 candidates.
Question policy (strict):

- You MUST answer anything discoverable from code/tests/fixtures/logs or by running repo tooling; do not ask me.
- Allowed questions only:
  - Product/UX decisions not encoded in repo/docs
  - External constraints not in repo/docs (policies, launch dates, KPIs, access)
  - Doc-path ambiguity (top 2-3 candidates)
  - Missing access/permissions
- If you think you need to ask, first state where you looked; ask only after exhausting repo evidence.


OUTPUT FORMAT (console only):

- Doc: <path> -- status: <draft|active|complete> -- current phase: <phase>
