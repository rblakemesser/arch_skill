description: "01) New doc: create canonical plan doc + draft North Star from blurb, then confirm with user."
argument-hint: "<Paste the change request / symptoms / goal. This becomes the draft TL;DR + North Star. No structured args needed.>"
---
# /prompts:arch-new — $ARGUMENTS
# COMMUNICATING WITH USERNAME (IMPORTANT)

- Start console output with a 1 line reminder of our North Star.
- Then give the punch line in plain English.
- Then give a short update in natural English (bullets optional; use them only if they improve clarity).
- Never be pedantic. Assume shorthand is intentional (long day); optimize for the real goal.
- Put deep details (commands, logs, exhaustive lists) in DOC_PATH / WORKLOG_PATH, not in console output.

Execution rule: do not block on unrelated dirty files in git; ignore unrecognized changes. If committing, stage only files you touched (or as instructed).
Do not preface with a plan or restate these instructions. Begin work immediately. If a tool-call preamble is required by system policy, keep it to a single terse line with no step list. Console output should be short and high-signal (no logs); see CONSOLE OUTPUT for required content.
Use the freeform blurb provided after the command ($ARGUMENTS) as the working intent.
If you already have an existing doc that needs to be converted into the canonical format (instead of creating a new doc), use `/prompts:arch-reformat`.
Create a new architecture document in `docs/` using the template below.
Name the file yourself using this rule:
- `docs/<TITLE_SCREAMING_SNAKE>_<DATE>.md`
- TITLE_SCREAMING_SNAKE = derived from the blurb as a short 5–9 word title, uppercased, spaces → `_`, punctuation removed.
- DATE = today's date in YYYY-MM-DD (no user input required).
Example: blurb="Redesign replay phase machine to be SSOT"
→ `docs/REDESIGN_REPLAY_PHASE_MACHINE_TO_BE_SSOT_2026-01-16.md`
Apply the **single-document rule**: all planning and decisions live in this doc.
Do not create additional planning docs.
Documentation-only (planning):
- This prompt creates/edits docs only. DO NOT modify code.
- Do not commit/push unless explicitly requested in $ARGUMENTS.
CRITICAL: The North Star MUST be correct.
- Draft the TL;DR and Section 0 (Holistic North Star) from $ARGUMENTS (do not leave placeholders there).
- Then pause and ask the user to confirm/correct the North Star before proceeding to research/architecture execution.
- If the user provides edits, update the doc and re-ask for confirmation until the user says “yes”.

Write the filled template into the new doc file. Do not paste the full document to the console (you may print only the drafted TL;DR + North Star for confirmation).

# 0) Holistic North Star

## 0.1 The claim (falsifiable)
> <If we do X, then Y is true, measured by Z, by date/condition W>

## 0.2 In scope
- UX surfaces (what users will see change):
  - <screen/state/flow>
- Technical scope (what code will change):
  - <module/contract/boundary>

## 0.3 Out of scope
- UX surfaces (what users must NOT see change):
  - <screen/state/flow>
- Technical scope (explicit exclusions):
  - <module/boundary we will not touch>

## 0.4 Definition of done (acceptance evidence)
- <observable acceptance criteria, not vibes>
- Evidence plan (common-sense; non-blocking):
  - Primary signal (keep it minimal; prefer existing tests/checks): <existing test/check OR instrumentation/log signature OR manual QA checklist> — <what you’ll look for>
  - Optional second signal (only if needed): <...> — <what you’ll look for>
  - Default: do NOT add bespoke screenshot harnesses / drift scripts unless they already exist in-repo or are explicitly requested.
  - Avoid negative-value tests/gates: do NOT add “deleted code not referenced” tests, visual-constant tests (colors/margins/pixels), doc-driven inventory gates, or mock-only interaction tests.
- Metrics / thresholds (if relevant):
  - <metric>: <threshold> — measured via <dash/test/log>

## 0.5 Key invariants (fix immediately if violated)
- <if these fail, fix before continuing>
- Example: “No silent fallbacks.” “No dual sources of truth.” “No undefined behavior.”

---

# 1) Key Design Considerations (what matters most)

## 1.1 Priorities (ranked)
1) <#1>
2) <#2>
3) <#3>

## 1.2 Constraints
- Correctness:
- Performance:
- Offline / latency:
- Compatibility / migration:
- Operational / observability:

## 1.3 Architectural principles (rules we will enforce)
- <e.g., fail-loud boundaries, DI rules, no business logic in UI, etc.>
- Pattern propagation via comments (high leverage; no spam):
  - When we introduce a new SSOT/contract or a non-obvious “gotcha”, add a short doc comment in the canonical boundary module explaining the invariant + how to extend it safely.
  - Do NOT comment everything; comment the tricky bits we want to propagate forward.

## 1.4 Known tradeoffs (explicit)
- <tradeoff> → chosen direction + why
- Alternatives rejected + why

---

# 2) Problem Statement (existing architecture + why change)

## 2.1 What exists today
- <system overview in 5–10 bullets>
- Primary flows / control paths:
  - <flow A>
  - <flow B>

## 2.2 What’s broken / missing (concrete)
- Symptoms:
- Root causes (hypotheses):
- Why now:

## 2.3 Constraints implied by the problem
- <constraints derived from reality, not preference>

---

# 3) Research Grounding (external + internal “ground truth”)

## 3.1 External anchors (papers, systems, prior art)
- <source> — <what we borrow / what we reject> — <why it applies>

## 3.2 Internal ground truth (code as spec)
- **Authoritative behavior anchors (do not reinvent):**
  - `<path>` — <what it defines>
- **Existing patterns we will reuse:**
  - `<path>` — <pattern>

## 3.3 Open questions from research
- Q1:
- Q2:
- What evidence would settle them:

---

# 4) Current Architecture (as-is)

## 4.1 On-disk structure
```text
<tree of relevant dirs/files>
```

## 4.2 Control paths (runtime)

* Flow A:

  * Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3
* Flow B:

  * ...

## 4.3 Object model + key abstractions

* Key types:
* Ownership boundaries:
* Public APIs:

  * `Foo.doThing(args) -> Result`

## 4.4 Observability + failure behavior today

* Logs:
* Metrics:
* Failure surfaces:
* Common failure modes:

## 4.5 UI surfaces (ASCII mockups, if UI work)

```ascii
<ASCII mockups for current UI states, if relevant>
```

---

# 5) Target Architecture (to-be)

## 5.1 On-disk structure (future)

```text
<new/changed tree>
```

## 5.2 Control paths (future)

* Flow A (new):
* Flow B (new):

## 5.3 Object model + abstractions (future)

* New types/modules:
* Explicit contracts:
* Public APIs (new/changed):

  * `Foo.doThingV2(args) -> Result`
  * Migration notes:

## 5.4 Invariants and boundaries

* Fail-loud boundaries:
* Single source of truth:
* Determinism contracts (time/randomness):
* Performance / allocation boundaries:

## 5.5 UI surfaces (ASCII mockups, if UI work)

```ascii
<ASCII mockups for target UI states, if relevant>
```

# 6) Call-Site Audit (exhaustive change inventory)

## 6.1 Change map (table)

| Area     | File   | Symbol / Call site | Current behavior | Required change | Why         | New API / contract | Tests impacted |
| -------- | ------ | ------------------ | ---------------- | --------------- | ----------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| <module> | <path> | <fn/cls>           | <today>          | <diff>          | <rationale> | <new usage>        | <tests>        |

## 6.2 Migration notes

* Deprecated APIs:
* Compatibility shims (if any):
* Delete list (what must be removed):

---

# 7) Depth-First Phased Implementation Plan (authoritative)

> Rule: systematic build, foundational first; every phase has exit criteria + explicit verification plan (tests optional).

## Phase 1 — <foundation>

* Goal:
* Work:
* Verification (smallest signal):
* Docs/comments (propagation; only if needed):
* Exit criteria:
* Rollback:

## Phase N — <end state + cleanup>

* Goal:
* Work:
* Verification (smallest signal):
* Docs/comments (propagation; only if needed):
* Exit criteria:
* Rollback:

---

# 8) Verification Strategy (common-sense; non-blocking)

> Principle: avoid verification bureaucracy. Prefer the smallest existing signal. If sim/video/screenshot capture is flaky or slow, rely on targeted instrumentation + a short manual QA checklist and keep moving.
> Default: 1–3 checks total. Do not invent new harnesses/frameworks/scripts unless they already exist in-repo and are the cheapest guardrail.
> Default: keep UI/manual verification as a finalization checklist (don’t gate implementation).
> Default: do NOT create “proof” tests that assert deletions, visual constants, or doc inventories. Prefer compile/typecheck + behavior-level assertions only when they buy confidence.
> Also: document any new tricky invariants/gotchas in code comments at the SSOT/contract boundary so future refactors don’t break the pattern.

## 8.1 Unit tests (contracts)

* What invariants are unit-locked:

## 8.2 Integration tests (flows)

* Critical flows:
* Failure injection:

## 8.3 E2E / device tests (realistic)

* Scenarios:
* Evidence / artifacts (optional; do not block):

---

# 9) Rollout / Ops / Telemetry

* Backward compatibility:

## 9.2 Telemetry changes

* New events:
* New properties:
* Dashboards / alerting:

## 9.3 Operational runbook

* Debug checklist:
* Common failure modes + fixes:

CONSOLE OUTPUT (USERNAME-style; north star confirmation):
This is the information it should contain but you should communicate it naturally in english not as a bulleted list that is hard to parse for the user.
Include:
- North Star reminder (1 line; what we’re trying to accomplish overall)
- Punchline (1 line; what you need from USERNAME right now)
- Doc created path
- Draft TL;DR (outcome/problem/approach/plan)
- Draft North Star for confirmation (claim/scope/definition-of-done/key invariants)
- Ask USERNAME to confirm “yes/no” (and paste edits if “no”)
