description: Update canonical architecture doc with execution progress.
argument-hint: DOC_PATH=<path> PHASE=<n>
---
Execution rule: do not block on unrelated dirty files in git; ignore unrecognized changes. If committing, stage only files you touched (or as instructed).
Do not preface with a plan or restate these instructions. Begin work immediately. If a tool-call preamble is required by system policy, keep it to a single terse line with no step list. Console output must ONLY use the specified format; no extra narrative.
Update $DOC_PATH with progress for Phase $PHASE.
Add decisions to Decision Log.
Do not create additional planning docs.
Write the progress update into $DOC_PATH and append the decision entry to the Decision Log. Do not paste the full block to the console.
