description: Kick off the 4-phase architecture workflow (lightweight alignment).
argument-hint: DOC_PATH=<path>
---
Execution rule: do not block on unrelated dirty files in git; ignore unrecognized changes. If committing, stage only files you touched (or as instructed).
We will work out of a single canonical doc at $DOC_PATH.
Start Phase 1 (Research). Ask clarifying questions only if there are multiple viable options or ambiguity.
Summarize research anchors and pause for a lightweight check before Phase 2.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
## Phase 1 Kickoff (Research)
- Repo: <current>
- Target doc: <path>
- Assumptions:
  - <list>
- Questions (only if ambiguous):
  - <Q1>
- Plan:
  1) <step>
  2) <step>

## Phase 1 Summary (fill after research)
- Internal anchors:
  - <path> — <behavior>
- External anchors:
  - <source> — <adopt/reject>
- Open questions:
  - <Q> — <evidence needed>

Decision: proceed to Phase 2? (yes/no)
