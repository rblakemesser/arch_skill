description: "02) Phase 1 kickoff: research setup + checkpoints."
argument-hint: DOC_PATH=<path> (optional)
---
Execution rule: do not block on unrelated dirty files in git; ignore unrecognized changes. If committing, stage only files you touched (or as instructed).
Do not preface with a plan or restate these instructions. Begin work immediately. If a tool-call preamble is required by system policy, keep it to a single terse line with no step list. Console output must ONLY use the specified format; no extra narrative.
If DOC_PATH is not provided, locate the most relevant architecture doc by semantic match to $ARGUMENTS and the current conversation; prefer the doc that explicitly matches the topic and is most recently updated among relevant candidates. If you cannot determine a clear winner, ask the user to choose from the top 2–3 candidates.
Do not ask the user questions during investigation. Resolve by reading more code and searching the repo. Ask only if required information is not present in the repo or doc and cannot be inferred (e.g., product choice or external constraint).
We will work out of a single canonical doc at $DOC_PATH.
Start Phase 1 (Research). Ask clarifying questions only if there are multiple viable options or ambiguity.
Summarize research anchors and pause for a lightweight check before Phase 2.
Write the kickoff + summary block into $DOC_PATH (insert after TL;DR, before #0). Do not paste the full block to the console.

DOCUMENT INSERT FORMAT (insert after TL;DR, before #0):
## Phase 1 Kickoff (Research)
- Repo: <current>
- Target doc: <path>
- Assumptions:
  - <list>
- Questions (only if ambiguous):
  - <Q1> (or "None")
- Plan:
  1) <step>
  2) <step>

## Phase 1 Summary (fill after research)
- Internal anchors:
  - <path> — <behavior>
- External anchors:
  - <source> — <adopt/reject>
- Open questions:
  - <Q> — <evidence needed>

Decision: proceed to Phase 2? (yes/no)

CONSOLE OUTPUT FORMAT (summary + open questions only):
Summary:
- <bullet>
Open questions:
- Proceed to Phase 2? (yes/no)
- <other open questions, if any>
