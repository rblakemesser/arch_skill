description: Kick off the 4-phase architecture workflow (lightweight alignment).
argument-hint: DOC_PATH=<path>
---
Execution rule: do not block on unrelated dirty files in git; ignore unrecognized changes. If committing, stage only files you touched (or as instructed).
Do not preface with a plan or restate these instructions. Begin work immediately. If a tool-call preamble is required by system policy, keep it to a single terse line with no step list. Console output must ONLY use the specified format; no extra narrative.
We will work out of a single canonical doc at $DOC_PATH.
Start Phase 1 (Research). Ask clarifying questions only if there are multiple viable options or ambiguity.
Summarize research anchors and pause for a lightweight check before Phase 2.
Write the kickoff + summary block into $DOC_PATH (insert after TL;DR, before #0). Do not paste the full block to the console.
