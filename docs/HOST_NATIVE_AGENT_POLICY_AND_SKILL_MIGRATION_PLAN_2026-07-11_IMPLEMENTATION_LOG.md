# Host-Native Agent Policy and Skill Migration Implementation Log

Plan: `docs/HOST_NATIVE_AGENT_POLICY_AND_SKILL_MIGRATION_PLAN_2026-07-11.md`
Audit log: none
Active scope: whole approved plan
Scope contract anchor: plan sections `Implementation plan`, `Acceptance tests for the policy itself`, and `Non-goals`
Scope status: complete
Last updated: 2026-07-11 11:14:12 CDT
Implementation payload: `7eaa2ffb5d48cb99bfe644abd7ae12bd419f502f`

## Resume Snapshot

- Current state: Phases 0-7 are implemented, verified, reviewed, committed, pushed, and installed. The shared policy, governance, transport owners, orchestrators, review/loop/arch consumers, intentional external lanes, metadata, installed-relative shared references, public docs, and complete 46-package/182-edge DAG are integrated. Two broad fresh Terra xhigh cold readers plus bounded post-repair checks completed; their five verified findings are repaired, and the final fresh confirmation verdict is `approve` with no required repairs.
- Next useful move: none for this scope; hand the publication receipt to the user.
- Do not redo unless stale: the 46-package inventory, metadata inventory, base commit, install-surface orientation, and skill/prompt authoring reference reads.
- Known blockers: none. Existing untracked build outputs, vendor expansions, unrelated reports, `.arch_skill/`, `.firecrawl/`, and `uv.lock` are user-owned and outside this scope.
- Native subagents used or useful next: all migration groups, integration review, and three clean read-only DAG walkers are complete. No additional agent work is required before publication.

## Continuous Review Ledger

| Finding | Source | Status | Repair anchor | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GOV-01 | Clean native governance migration | Closed | Twelve files in four governance packages | Parent accepted the semantic split: shared policy owns orchestration; packages own authoring/audit roles |
| ADP-01 | Clean native adapter/consensus migration | Closed | Fifteen files in three packages | Parent accepted native-first role semantics and preserved external invocation/receipt mechanics |
| REV-01 | Clean native review-consumer migration | Closed | Thirty-two files in six packages | Parent accepted clean read-only context, proportional fanout, exact repair resume, and parent accounting |
| DAG-01 | Parent `skill-flow` contract repair | Closed | `skill-flow` SKILL, YAML, walk/substrate references, and regenerated DAG | Dollar-prefixed and exact resolving backticked peers count by semantic context; code, variables, and inert examples remain excluded; 46-node/182-edge graph passes consistency checks |
| ORC-01 | Clean native orchestrator migration | Closed | `plan-conductor`, `stepwise`, and `arch-epic` live packages | Native-first role dispatch, explicit context/continuation, parent fanout, and deliberate external adapters preserve the existing workflow gates |
| LOOP-01 | Clean native loop-consumer migration | Closed | `arch-docs`, `audit-loop`, `audit-loop-sim`, `comment-loop`, and `bugs-flow` | Exact implementer repair, new clean critics, read-only controls, and parent repository-state accounting are aligned |
| ARC-01 | Clean native arch-consumer migration | Closed | `arch-step`, `arch-step-goal-prompt`, `lilarch`, and `miniarch-step` | Clean native mapping/review plus exact repair continuation preserve scope, phase, audit, and readiness gates |
| INT-01 | Clean native integration review | Closed | Shared policy, routing docs, metadata, adapters, consumers, intentional lanes, and installed references | Repaired four initial findings, installed-relative legacy shared links, and context/continuation schema leaks; final verdict `APPROVED` with no remaining finding in its reviewed scope |
| TERRA-01 | First fresh Terra xhigh cold read | Closed | `AGENTS.md` and `codex-review-yolo/SKILL.md` | Removed the stale external-process permission gate and narrowed generic fresh-eyes triggers to the exact external yolo lane; affected validation and installation passed |
| TERRA-02 | Second fresh ephemeral Terra xhigh cold read | Closed | `README.md` and this implementation log | Corrected the CRG install contract and reconciled the resume, scope, proof, and decision ledgers with completed verification; release recheck remains explicit |
| TERRA-03 | Fresh bounded Terra xhigh release recheck | Closed | `README.md` and `docs/arch_skill_usage_guide.md` | Removed the remaining generic fresh-eyes route to yolo from both public docs; final surgical confirmation remains explicit |

## Pass Notes

### 2026-07-11 08:54 CDT — Freeze current implementation truth

- Intent: establish a stable, non-destructive base before changing the broad skill surface.
- Changed: created this implementation log only.
- Read: current commit history and status; all live skill/metadata inventories; current agent-related references; approved plan; required skill-authoring, prompt-authoring, plan-implement, fresh-consult, and amir-publish doctrine.
- Proof: `main` and `origin/main` both point to `e43811b`; the tracked tree was clean; 46 live packages and 35 OpenAI metadata files were present.
- Review: unrelated untracked files are explicitly protected as user-owned. The previous concurrent tracked changes are now committed and therefore safe to build on.
- Next: author the shared policy and propagate its install/documentation contract.

### 2026-07-11 09:05 CDT — Shared contract and governance integrated

- Intent: centralize agent semantics before changing workflows and make future authoring preserve that ownership.
- Changed: added the shared orchestration policy, install verification assertions, README/usage guidance, the concise repo routing rule, and the four governance package migrations.
- Read: the governance child return and its full assigned diff; `$agents-md-authoring` pattern, content-budget, and scope references.
- Proof: governance child parsed all edited YAML/frontmatter, resolved shared-policy paths, preserved named scope/convergence references, and passed its assigned `git diff --check`; parent `git diff --check` also passed.
- Review: no repair finding opened. The changes judge semantics rather than exact words and keep runtime metadata aligned.
- Next: finish and audit the transport-owner and orchestration migrations.

### 2026-07-11 09:19 CDT — Adapters, review consumers, and walker contract integrated

- Intent: move reusable roles onto native-clean defaults while preserving deliberate external capabilities and independent review quality.
- Changed: migrated `agent-delegate`, `fresh-consult`, `model-consensus`, the three cynical reviews, exhaustive review, plan audit, plan implement, and the `skill-flow` walker/extraction contract. Public docs now describe the external adapter and clean native review lanes.
- Read: complete adapter/consensus and review-consumer child returns; all six review-consumer SKILL contracts and key child-prompt references; all three adapter/consensus SKILL contracts and their core workflow/prompt references.
- Proof: both returned groups ran `npx skills check`, parsed edited YAML/frontmatter, and passed assigned `git diff --check`; parent repo-wide `git diff --check` remains clean. Final proof is intentionally pending because other skill edits are active.
- Review: no repair finding opened. External Codex SQLite/WAL cost remains explanatory rather than prohibitive; clean review, exact-role resume, no-nested-fanout, and parent integration are explicit.
- Next: finish the three large orchestrators and remaining loop/arch consumers before graph regeneration.

### 2026-07-11 09:44 CDT — Full migration integrated; controlled graph walk started

- Intent: finish every policy-owning and policy-consuming package, reconcile the suite at installed-runtime boundaries, and begin evidence-backed graph regeneration.
- Changed: integrated the three large orchestrators, five loop consumers, four arch consumers, and the three intentional external/durable lanes; aligned their metadata and public routing; normalized all live shared-doctrine/helper references to installed-relative paths; separated starting context from continuation in adapter, consult, and consensus prompt/receipt contracts; made `codex-review-yolo` repository-state verification mandatory for its `danger-full-access` profile and corrected its SQLite/WAL concurrency explanation.
- Read: complete native child returns for the orchestrator, loop, and arch groups; all preliminary and final findings from the clean native integration auditor; repaired paths and schema blocks after each finding.
- Proof: repeated package checks from assigned groups passed; Stepwise's 33 unit tests, runner compile/help checks, YAML/frontmatter parsing, live shared-link resolution, and repo-wide `git diff --check` passed. Final repo/install proof remains pending until the DAG artifact stops changing.
- Review: the clean integration auditor returned `APPROVED` with no remaining finding in its reviewed scope. The parent separately accepted the orchestrator and arch returns, while final serialized Terra readers will audit the entire integrated surface cold.
- Next: accept all three clean walker slices, replace the false-isolation DAG, then run final package/install verification.

### 2026-07-11 10:37 CDT — Complete semantic DAG regenerated

- Intent: replace the misleading one-edge baseline graph with a complete evidence substrate and recompute waste conclusions before final proof.
- Changed: expanded the prompt-only extraction contract to count both dollar-prefixed peers and exact resolving unprefixed backticked peers in relationship-bearing prose; explicitly excluded fenced/indented code, variables, commands, modes, filenames, self references, and quoted/template examples; regenerated the companion DAG.
- Read: every live `SKILL.md` and live `references/*.md` across all 46 packages through three clean native walker identities. The host exposed one nested child slot, so groups ran sequentially; the third walker used exact-handle bounded continuations rather than replacement when its first return was too large.
- Proof: every package has one accepted owner; the artifact has 46 nodes, 182 Mermaid edges, the same 182 sorted evidence-table rows, zero unresolved targets, closed enums, 5–12-word labels, current evidence anchors, no duplicate tuples, and SHA-256 `d19fa544185e4a924ec5d26ea59930aeb6434993e9d37f83afe80cdda5f927b8`. Parent repeated the 46/182/182 counts, hash, and `git diff --check`.
- Review: six graph-isolated direct-invocation utilities are not treated as dead without separate usage evidence; no over-promotion or duplicate canonical owner is established. The apparent `$changeset-validation` edge was correctly adjudicated as quoted hypothetical output, not a live dependency.
- Next: run final local and installed-surface verification, then serialize the requested Terra xhigh cold readers after unrelated active external Codex runs quiet.

### 2026-07-11 10:39 CDT — Local and installed surfaces verified

- Intent: prove the finished source packages and the real multi-host install layout before asking cold readers to judge the implementation.
- Changed: installed the current tree into the local Agents, Claude Code, and Gemini skill roots; no source doctrine changed in this pass.
- Proof: `make install` and `make verify_install` both exited successfully. The installed shared-policy copies at `~/.agents/skills/_shared/`, `~/.claude/skills/_shared/`, and `~/.gemini/skills/_shared/` exactly match the source SHA-256 `92201ac41d0f0641bbefc7f14e1c9886255fa20884ab29a15b4591a874fed4d9`.
- Review: unrelated untracked reports, generated build directories, tool state, lockfiles, and vendored expansions remain untouched. The final cold reads are waiting for unrelated external Codex jobs to finish so this implementation does not add avoidable SQLite/WAL pressure.
- Next: run the two fresh Terra xhigh cold reads serially, repair any verified findings, repeat affected proof, then publish.

### 2026-07-11 10:48 CDT — First Terra cold read repaired

- Intent: obtain a clean, exact-model policy/semantics judgment after implementation and act only on source-grounded findings.
- Read: fresh external `gpt-5.6-terra` at `xhigh` reviewed the plan, implementation log, shared policy, public routing, complete diff, and agent-using packages without children or writes.
- Finding: the reader returned `not-approved` because `AGENTS.md` still required explicit user permission for external consultation/delegation and `codex-review-yolo` still included two generic fresh-eyes triggers despite its exact-profile boundary.
- Changed: replaced the permission gate with shared-policy judgment that weighs concrete external benefit against cost; narrowed the yolo triggers to explicit profile, receipt, or selected external-yolo benefits.
- Proof: the reviewer left repository status, tracked diff, and protected untracked artifact hashes unchanged. After repair, `npx skills check`, `git diff --check`, `make install`, and `make verify_install` passed; the only package-check output was the pre-existing non-interactive upstream-deletion warning.
- Receipt: `/tmp/fresh-consult/host-native-agent-policy-terra-cold-read-1-20260711/turn-01/` records prompt, final, events, stderr, session id, execution contract, and chain.
- Next: wait for unrelated external Codex work to clear, then run the second fresh Terra xhigh completeness/integration reader against the repaired state.

### 2026-07-11 11:03 CDT — Second Terra cold read repaired

- Intent: independently audit phase completeness, install truth, metadata/scripts, proof freshness, scope containment, and the complete semantic DAG after the first reader's repairs.
- Read: a fresh external `gpt-5.6-terra` at `xhigh` reviewed the repository in one-shot `--ephemeral` mode. That preserved prompt/event/final receipts without persisting a resumable session or agent-graph edge while unrelated external Codex fanout was active.
- Finding: the reader returned `not-approved` because README incorrectly claimed normal installation also installs/builds CRG, and this log's top-level resume, scope, proof, and decision ledgers still called completed verification pending.
- Changed: README now routes CRG setup to the separate `make crg-setup` target and says normal install does not rebuild the graph; the authoritative log tables now match the proof already recorded in their pass notes while keeping publication and a fresh post-repair release verdict pending.
- Proof: the reader independently confirmed the runtime migration, installed hash parity, installed relative references, metadata, generated/vendor containment, and the 46-node/182-edge DAG. Its before/after repository status, diff, and protected untracked artifact hashes matched exactly.
- Receipt: `/tmp/fresh-consult/host-native-agent-policy-terra-cold-read-2-20260711/turn-01/` records prompt, final, events, stderr, ephemeral thread id, execution contract, and chain.
- Next: rerun affected local/install proof, then obtain one fresh narrow Terra xhigh release recheck against the fully repaired state before publishing.

### 2026-07-11 11:07 CDT — Bounded Terra release recheck repaired

- Intent: verify the four broad-reader repairs in a fresh bounded context without paying for a third whole-repository audit.
- Finding: the rechecker confirmed all four direct-owner repairs, then returned `not-approved` because README still generically paired `codex-review-yolo` with `fresh-consult` for broad fresh-eyes work.
- Changed: both README and the matching usage-guide practical rule now route generic broad fresh-eyes work to `fresh-consult` and reserve `codex-review-yolo` for the explicit `-p yolo` profile or external receipt contract.
- Proof: the rechecker did not change repository state; direct searches found the same stale route in both public docs, so both owning surfaces were repaired together.
- Receipt: `/tmp/fresh-consult/host-native-agent-policy-terra-release-recheck-20260711/turn-01/` records the bounded prompt, final, events, stderr, and ephemeral thread id; execution and chain metadata are added with final proof.
- Next: rerun affected documentation and install checks, then obtain one fresh surgical Terra xhigh confirmation before publication.

### 2026-07-11 11:09 CDT — Final Terra confirmation approved

- Intent: confirm the last public-routing repair in a fresh exact-model context without reopening settled whole-repository scope.
- Read: a fresh ephemeral `gpt-5.6-terra` xhigh reviewer inspected the prior finding, both public routing surfaces, the yolo and fresh-consult role owners, focused diffs, and this release ledger.
- Verdict: `approve`; required repairs `none`. The reviewer confirmed generic fresh-eyes work routes to `fresh-consult`, yolo remains the explicit profile/receipt lane, both public docs agree, and publication alone remains pending.
- Proof: the reviewer left repository status, tracked diff, and protected untracked artifact hashes unchanged. `git diff --check`, `make verify_install`, and direct route searches passed after the repair.
- Receipt: `/tmp/fresh-consult/host-native-agent-policy-terra-final-confirmation-20260711/turn-01/` records prompt, final, events, stderr, ephemeral thread id, execution contract, and chain.
- Next: run the frozen final proof bundle, stage only intentional files, and publish through `$amir-publish`.

### 2026-07-11 11:11 CDT — Frozen final proof passed

- Intent: prove the exact reviewed payload once more before staging and publication.
- Proof: `npx skills check`, `make install`, `make verify_install`, and `git diff --check` passed. The only package-check output beyond success was the existing non-interactive warning about four upstream Impeccable deletions.
- Structural proof: 46 skill frontmatters and 36 OpenAI YAML files parsed with required fields; all installed-relative shared references resolved; no tracked `build/` or `vendor/` path changed; no live skill retained a repo-root shared-policy reference.
- Runtime proof: all 33 Stepwise unit tests passed; Stepwise top-level and `step-spawn` help smokes passed; Arch Epic top-level and `auto-init` help smokes passed.
- Graph/install proof: the DAG still has 46 nodes, 182 Mermaid edges, 182 evidence rows, and SHA-256 `d19fa544185e4a924ec5d26ea59930aeb6434993e9d37f83afe80cdda5f927b8`. Source and all three installed shared-policy copies still match SHA-256 `92201ac41d0f0641bbefc7f14e1c9886255fa20884ab29a15b4591a874fed4d9`.
- Next: stage only the intentional tracked edits and five related new source/docs files, inspect the staged payload, then publish.

### 2026-07-11 11:14 CDT — Published across the cluster

- Intent: publish the independently approved payload and prove that every configured target received the live shared policy.
- Git receipt: committed `Unify native and external agent policy` as `7eaa2ffb5d48cb99bfe644abd7ae12bd419f502f` and pushed it to `origin/main`.
- Local receipt: `make install` and `make verify_install` passed on the current `Amir-M5` host.
- Remote receipt: sequential `$amir-publish` runs succeeded on `amirs-m3-max-new`, `agents@amirs-mac-studio`, `home`, and `claw`; `amir-m5` was skipped because it is the current host. Every checked repo reported `7eaa2ff`, and the Agents, Claude, and Gemini shared-policy files existed on every target.
- Scope protection: unrelated untracked reports, generated build directories, tool state, `uv.lock`, and vendor expansions remained outside the commit.
- Next: publish this docs-only receipt update so the canonical plan and log describe the completed release state.
