## High‑frequency implementation directives
- “now your job is to fully implement docs/psv2-psmobile3-lessons-parity-alignment-plan.md systematically and thoughtfully, updating the doc as you make progress. Call out any issues in the doc as you go but do not become blocked. When you're done get a review from opus/gemini give them any files they need. Make sure tests pass and maek dev works. Then open a detailed PR using docs/PR_TEMPLATES.txt .”

- “Your job is to build the full scope of docs/psv2-auth-backend-login-roadmap.md one phase at a time, as a stack of branches, one branch per phase. You will update the document as you go and as you finish you'll ask opus/gemini for a code review AND YOU WILL EXPLICITLY ASK THEM TO AUDIT THE CODE VERSUS THE FULL REQUIREMENTS OF THE PHASE AND ITERATE UNTIL THEY AGREE IT IS COMPLETED. For any blockers you should record them in the document and proceed as best you can given the blocker, looking to get as much built as possible. For example, using a placeholder value to unblock yourself if you don't have a credential, etc. You should commit and push as you complete phases after making sure all tests pass and analyze is clean. Iterate autonomously and as you finish a phase, cut the next phases branch and proceed. IT IS CRITICAL that you're referencing the ground truths in ../psmobile4. Keep context on our overall goal reminding yourself often that we're looking to intelligently port ../psmobile4 front end to flutter natively while maintaining full backend, iOS app store and google play store compatibility, as well as our other deps such as clerk, etc.”

## Planning + architecture doc requests
- “put a phased impleentation plan, depth first systematic build at top of document fully specify each phase its exit criteria leave nothing out, more phases better than fewer”
- “i want it to cross link to the audits and ground truths in each phase and be much more exhaustive”
- “fully specify the fulla rchitecture for this plan, files on disk, all patterns (idiomatic, flutter native), for eahc phase point to the architecture that matters really go deep on each component and all the parts that must get built and fully specify them, control flow, object hierarchies, test patterns, everything.”
- “obviously we want feedback above the scrim go super deep on this architecturally and build a new doc out using one of the planning doc templates in docs dir”
- “Okay now I want you to review our research in @docs/2d_gaming_engine_paradigm_research.md and I'd like for you to read @docs/skia_playables/PLAYABLES_V2_SKIA_REACT_ENGINE_MISMATCH_WRITEUP_2026-01-16.md again and I'd like for you to create a new document which proposes a concrete refactored Skia playable and lessons architecture. It should show all core primitives, all the public APIs, the fully realized structure on disk, the idiomatic patterns and why they solve the problems we're having today and why they are elegant/clean. It should show how *EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR PLAYABLES WE PORTED TO SKIA* will be ported, what objects they share, how all structure on disk looks, how all transitions are handled.”

## PSV2 planning + architecture directives (recent)
- “› now I want you to fully implement docs/psv2-lesson-runner-plan.md systematically updating the document as you go, call out any issues you encountered along the way and as you complete phases have opus/gemini code review for idiomatic compliance with patterns and plan, accomplishing the *INTENT* of the plan and *COMPLETELY finishing the phase as well as UX compliance with our RN ground truths. Commit and push as you finish phases.”
- “okay now your job is to fully and systematically implement docs/psv2-lessons-porting-guide.md updating the document and testing as you go, as you finish a phase get a code review from opus/gemini and commit/push and then move to the next phase. Have opus/gemini review for idiomatic nature adn compliance to ground truth ../psmobile3 UX and only move forward when you are aligned with them (give them files they need) but youd ont' have to take all pedantic or purely hypothetical advice they offer. When you're fully complete use docs/PR_TEMPLATES.txt to open a detailed PR.”
- “your job is to fully and systematically implement docs/psv2-puzzles-ux-parity-architecture-plan.md, updating the document as you go. As you finish a phase get a code review from opus/gemini (give them files they need) for fidelity of UX vs ground truth in ../psmobile and idiomatic implementation using our elegant flutter patterns and architecture.

## Architecture deep‑dives + audits
- “I want you to step back, start a document outlining the architecture of the snapshot system, the structure on disk, full object hierarchy, the call sites, flow of data, everything get all details into the document”
- “i want you to propose the most idiomatic and elegant architectural solution that creates clean central patterns and abstractions, doesn't create dual path patterns, no code duplication. Clean public APIs, etc. Award winning and stunning in elegance. put it in doc fully formed.”
- “I want you to take the best of our research, and the reecommendations and update the proposed architecture document to have the cleanest and most idiomatic, centralized and elegant solution. Minimal complexity or chances of drift, no scope creep. It should be shockingly simple but highly effective and elegant.”
- “I want you to integrate this JS thread work into the plan as part of the phases and the report card: PLAYABLES_V2_SKIA_JS_UI_THREAD_AUDIT_2026-01-13.md. Then I want you to make your process for each phase include updating the report cards by re-auditing the code against them:.”
- “I want you to get everything that is about our actual architectural plan out of the research doc”
- “i want you to fully document this pattern exactly as you see it in the logs in a new doc, ground the behavior in the code citing ground truth references”
- “ramp up on docs/skia_confetti_effects_bus_arch_plan_2026-01-14.md and audit the plan to figure out if it is introducing additional sources of truth or reducing complexity”
- “i want you to deeply audit our full skia_playables port (docs/skia_playables) code end to end and find all places we're doing shit painfully in JS or unecessarily back and forth between JS/UI threads building the worlds most complete and authoritative audit, save it as a new doc”

---

## UI/UX planning + audit prompts
- “ramp up on the play vs AI tab in psmobile, and go find the safe area policy we use on other tabs and the header we use on other tabs, and give me a plan to add a "Play" header and fix the safe area and remove the "X" button on the play tab”
- “lets keep the skia header and fix safe area + remove the X”
- “› also theres a HUGE space below action buttons, its like double the size of the button area itself that is causing the whole canvas to shrink unecessarily small during play.
  Figure out why taht is there update the plan to remove the double height spacing. Its like a 4 row grid basically.”
- “no you're not hearing me dude the problem sin't sometimes theres 2 sometimes theres four the problem is THERE IS ROOM FOR EIGHT BUTTONS [codex-clipboard-e4Hv1m.png 1764x1638]”
- “I want you start a new doc for a new set of action controls tha twill be built entirely in skia, so we're corner to corner skia based on the play vs AI. These will work differently than our current controls. 1) They will have 3 buttons visible one row at all times, some buttons may be disabled depending on legal actions in general the buttons will be a) Fold (always there sometimes active sometimes not) b) check or call (again always there, text depends on if facing a bet)  c) bet/raise always there text depends on if facing a bet or not and if the player has enough chips to bet or raise 2) when they click bet or raise they get a pop up slider and concenivence amount buttons that are scaled thoughtfully based on the pot size and the players remaining chip stack and the previous bet c) The behavior is coming from this old figma mock: https://www.figma.com/design/3YYekV0dpuVXvV3B1lPtJU/Poker-Skill---App?node-id=1227-46469&t=yoXDjp4uSH1ejgla-4 which you should download and analyze in detail. The look and feel should be our current application look and feel for all buttons, colors, styles, etc. It is important to note that we now support custom bet actions of any size per our rustai2/docs/PLAY_VS_AI.md . I want you to go insanely deep on this start a new document documenting all of the different states for the buttons, and surface any data you need from server you don't currently get so I can implement it. I want you to fully specify the UX with simple ascii wireframes and link to the figma for reference. I want a full on disk architecture plan as well as an object hierarchy, control flows, data hierarchy. I want you to specify enabled/disabled states for buttons *AND* i want you to specify the state for the buttons when it is not the players turn - they should change be present but disabled. Get the ascii mocks for the slider/convenience sizing in place in the doc. Show the heuristic you'll use to figure out the convenience button amounts. Walk through all the edge cases (can't afford to raise, all in with a call, blind play, all in on the big blind, everything). Make this a definitive and fully specified document”

---

## QA / automation / ops
- “ramp up on our qa psv2-qa-automation-architecture-plan.md I just want a simple command I can run to personally see some automation happening, give me a few options”
- “now your job is to sytematically implement docs/psv2-qa-automation-architecture-plan.md updating the document as you finish items, noting any issues you encounter. Test as it makes sense you can use existin gandroid sim. Commit and push after each phase, and when you finish get a code review from opus/gemini. Then open a detailed pr using docs/PR_TEMPLATES.txt”

---

## Simulator + tooling commands
- “find the latest build of the app and install it on the iphone 13 and iphone 16 pro sims, leave the regular iphone 16 sim alone. They are all running already adn metro is too just install thea pps”
- “I'm noticing that I think sometimes when we start metro its listening on localhost, and other times its on my tailscale domain. Can you see why?”
- “i always run either make ios-fresh or make metro-clean, compare those two”
- “turn on the qa bridge overlay in iphone 13 sim”
- “omfg turn  off the animations disabled flag”
- “turn animations back off”
- “turn them back on”

---

## Reviews + audits
- “great now do a full code review on this branch for compliance with our idiomatic and elegant patterns, also have opus/gemini do one (give them any files they need) and save your full code review as a comment on the PR”
- “diff this branch against origin/main and look for logging that is in hot loops and may affect performance give me a full audit”
- “read docs/skia_playables/PLAYABLES_V2_UX_LOAD_TRANSITIONS_2026-01-13.md and then diff this branch against origin/main and look for looping that may affect performance, look for logging in hot loops, and just spam”

---

## Document / asset ops
- “copy downloads dir latest file (-rw-r--r--@    1 aelaguiz  staff        23092 Jan 15 11:48 MVP recommendation_ “Play vs AI — Challenge Runs” .md) into our docs dir, rename it so it has no spaces”
- “commit just that file ignore other dirty files”

---

## Short approvals / follow‑ups
- “do it”
- “do that”
- “yeah commit it”
- “okay I'm going to make server changes but it'll take a while, can we build without those or do we need to wait for them to land?”
