# arch_skill

This repo ships installable agent skills centered on the arch suite for Codex CLI, Claude Code, and Gemini CLI.

The live arch suite is:

- `arch-step` — the broad full-arch execution surface; owns the full staged workflow, extended helper passes, bounded `auto-plan`, full-frontier `implement-loop`, compact `status`, and guided `advance`
- `miniarch-step` — the trimmed full-arch surface; keeps canonical arch docs, phasing, and real auto controllers without the broader `arch-step` helper surface
- `arch-docs` — standalone docs-audit and cleanup skill; owns topic-first stale-doc cleanup, consolidation onto canonical docs, working-doc retirement, and hook-backed Codex `auto` docs cleanup
- `arch-mini-plan` — one-pass canonical mini planning that hands follow-through to `miniarch-step` or `arch-step`
- `lilarch` — compact 1-3 phase feature flow
- `bugs-flow` — evidence-first bug analyze/fix/review flow
- `audit-loop` — exhaustive map-first repo audit loop with a root audit ledger, mandatory post-change self-audit, and Codex-only `auto` continuation
- `comment-loop` — exhaustive map-first repo comment hardening loop with a root comment ledger and Codex-only `auto` continuation
- `audit-loop-sim` — exhaustive map-first real-app automation audit loop with a root simulator ledger, mandatory post-change self-audit, and Codex-only `auto` continuation
- `goal-loop` — open-ended goal-seeking loop
- `north-star-investigation` — math-first investigation loop
- `arch-flow` — read-only "what's next?" router for arch docs
- `arch-skills-guide` — explains the suite and recommends the right live subskill

Use `miniarch-step` when the work still needs a real full-arch artifact and auto continuation, but you want the trimmed command surface instead of the broader `arch-step` helper surface. Use `arch-step` when the work is broader, more ambiguous, or needs the full helper surface.

Other shipped skills are:

- `delay-poll` — Codex-only delay-and-check controller that waits inside the installed `Stop` hook, re-runs a read-only condition check on a fixed interval, and resumes the same thread when the condition becomes true
- `agent-definition-auditor` — cold-reader scoring and findings for `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `SKILL.md`, `SOUL.md`, system prompts, and other agent-definition markdown
- `codemagic-builds` — Codemagic CI/CD build monitoring and build control via the Codemagic REST API
- `amir-publish` — prompt-only shortcut for committing, pushing, installing locally, then pulling and installing this repo across Amir's usual machines

Historical pre-skill materials are archived under `archive/` and `docs/archive/`. They are repo history, not part of the runtime surface.

## Install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:aelaguiz/arch_skill.git
cd arch_skill
make install
```

This installs the live skill surface to `~/.agents/skills/`, writes one arch_skill-managed Codex `Stop` hook in `~/.codex/hooks.json` pointing at `~/.agents/skills/arch-step/scripts/arch_controller_stop_hook.py`, repairs older two-hook arch_skill installs down to that one repo-managed entry, removes older `~/.codex/skills/<skill>` mirrors from previous installs, and also installs the Claude Code and Gemini CLI skill directories.

Codex automatic `auto-plan`, `implement-loop`, `auto-implement`, `arch-docs auto`, `audit-loop auto`, `comment-loop auto`, `audit-loop-sim auto`, and `delay-poll` also require the Codex feature flag:

```bash
codex features enable codex_hooks
```

For any of those Codex auto controllers, do not run the Stop hook yourself. After the controller is armed, just end the turn and let Codex run the installed Stop hook.

Each Codex auto controller now uses a session-scoped repo-local state file such as
`.codex/auto-plan-state.<SESSION_ID>.json`, `.codex/miniarch-step-auto-plan-state.<SESSION_ID>.json`, `.codex/miniarch-step-implement-loop-state.<SESSION_ID>.json`, `.codex/audit-loop-state.<SESSION_ID>.json`, `.codex/comment-loop-state.<SESSION_ID>.json`, `.codex/audit-loop-sim-state.<SESSION_ID>.json`, or `.codex/delay-poll-state.<SESSION_ID>.json`,
where `<SESSION_ID>` is the current `CODEX_THREAD_ID`. Separate Codex sessions can
run their own auto controllers concurrently in one repo. One session still must not
arm more than one controller at once.

To skip Gemini:

```bash
make install NO_GEMINI=1
```

Codex reads the same installed skill surface from `~/.agents/skills/`. `make install` also removes stale pre-skill command surfaces, removed competing skill packages, and older `~/.codex/skills/<skill>` mirrors so runtime routing stays unambiguous.

`delay-poll`, `codemagic-builds`, and `amir-publish` are installed only on the agents/Codex surface. `delay-poll` depends on the Codex `Stop` hook runtime; the others are local operator shortcuts.

### Remote install

```bash
make remote_install HOST=user@host
```

### Verify

```bash
make verify_install
```

This validates the installed active skill surface in `~/.agents/skills/`, checks that exactly one arch_skill-managed Codex `Stop` hook exists in `~/.codex/hooks.json` and points at `~/.agents/skills/arch-step/scripts/arch_controller_stop_hook.py`, confirms the old `~/.codex/skills/<skill>` mirrors are absent, and confirms removed competing skill packages are absent for the supported runtimes.

To confirm the Codex feature gate is enabled:

```bash
codex features list | rg '^codex_hooks\\s+.*\\strue$'
```

Restart your Codex, Claude Code, or Gemini CLI session after install so it reloads skills.

## Shipped skills

### `arch-step`

Use `arch-step` for broad or ambiguity-heavy full-arch work. It owns the standalone full-arch workflow, including:

- `new`
- `reformat`
- `research`
- `deep-dive`
- `external-research`
- `phase-plan`
- `auto-plan`
- `plan-enhance`
- `fold-in`
- `overbuild-protector`
- `consistency-pass`
- `review-gate`
- `implement`
- `implement-loop`
- `auto-implement`
- `audit-implementation`
- `status`
- `advance`

`consistency-pass` is the optional end-to-end cold-read helper before implementation. In Codex it uses two parallel cold reads; `auto-plan` runs it automatically after `phase-plan`. When it runs, `Decision: proceed to implement? yes` is only legal if the artifact is decision-complete and has no unresolved plan-shaping decisions left.

`auto-plan` is the Codex-only automatic planning controller. The user-facing command is still just `Use $arch-step auto-plan` or `Use $arch-step auto-plan docs/MY_PLAN.md`. In Codex, `DOC_PATH` is the planning ledger and `.codex/auto-plan-state.<SESSION_ID>.json` is only the armed controller state. On a fresh doc, the parent `auto-plan` pass runs only `research`, then ends its turn. On reruns, the installed Stop hook reads the doc and resumes from the first incomplete stage through `deep-dive` pass 1, `deep-dive` pass 2, `phase-plan`, and `consistency-pass`, then owns the successful `implement-loop` handoff. That handoff is allowed only when the artifact is decision-complete. If any unresolved plan-shaping decision remains, `auto-plan` must stop, clear controller state, and ask the user the exact blocker question. It is real only when `~/.codex/hooks.json` contains the repo-managed `Stop` entry pointing at `~/.agents/skills/arch-step/scripts/arch_controller_stop_hook.py` and `codex_hooks` is enabled. Preflight must verify that `hooks.json` entry and runner path, not a copied hook file under `~/.codex/hooks/`. Otherwise it must fail loud instead of pretending prompt-only chaining is enough.

`arch-step` does not have authority to silently cut approved behavior, acceptance criteria, or required implementation work because the agent wants to narrow scope on its own. If repo evidence cannot settle a plan-shaping choice, the skill must ask the user instead of guessing.

Before Section 7 is allowed to harden, `arch-step` should inspect adjacent surfaces tied to the same contract family, source of truth, migration boundary, or parity story, such as sibling formats, readers/writers, examples, fixtures, mirrored config, generated artifacts, or live docs. It should either include those surfaces now, explicitly defer or exclude them, or ask one exact blocker question instead of silently leaving them contradictory.

Compatibility posture is separate from `fallback_policy`. The plan should say whether it preserves the existing contract, performs a clean cutover, or uses an explicitly approved timeboxed bridge. `arch-step` should not assume backward compatibility by default just because it feels safer.

Section 7 phase plans should split work into one coherent self-contained unit per phase, with the most fundamental units first and later phases clearly building on earlier ones. When two decompositions are both valid, prefer more, smaller phases than fewer blended phases. New phase plans should use an explicit `Checklist (must all be done)` plus `Exit criteria (all required)` so a phase cannot be called complete while planned obligations are still implicit.

`implement-loop` is the Codex-only automatic full-frontier delivery controller. `auto-implement` is an exact user-facing synonym for the same controller. The user-facing command is `Use $arch-step implement-loop docs/MY_PLAN.md` or `Use $arch-step auto-implement docs/MY_PLAN.md`. It arms loop state before implementation work, then runs the full approved Section 7 frontier in order from the earliest incomplete or reopened phase through later reachable phases before handing control to fresh audit. It is real only when `~/.codex/hooks.json` contains the repo-managed `Stop` entry pointing at `~/.agents/skills/arch-step/scripts/arch_controller_stop_hook.py` and `codex_hooks` is enabled. Preflight must verify that `hooks.json` entry and runner path, not a copied hook file under `~/.codex/hooks/`. Otherwise it must fail loud instead of pretending prompt-only repetition is enough.

If the user says "do the full arch flow," "continue this architecture doc," or "audit implementation against the plan," the right live skill is `arch-step`.

### `miniarch-step`

Use `miniarch-step` when the work still needs a canonical full-arch doc, phased execution, and real Codex auto controllers, but does not need `arch-step`'s broader staged helper surface. It keeps the trimmed command surface without changing the full-work posture.

It keeps the same full-arch artifact shape and the same clean-audit handoff to `arch-docs`, but with a shorter command surface:

- `new`
- `reformat`
- `research`
- `deep-dive`
- `phase-plan`
- `auto-plan`
- `implement`
- `implement-loop`
- `auto-implement`
- `audit-implementation`
- `status`
- `advance`

`miniarch-step auto-plan` is the planning controller for the trimmed full-arch surface. In Codex, `DOC_PATH` is the planning ledger and `.codex/miniarch-step-auto-plan-state.<SESSION_ID>.json` is only the armed controller state. On a fresh doc, the parent pass runs only `research`, then ends its turn. On reruns, the installed Stop hook resumes from the first incomplete stage through `deep-dive` and `phase-plan`, then owns the successful `implement-loop` handoff.

`miniarch-step implement-loop` and `miniarch-step auto-implement` share the same full-frontier delivery controller. They arm `.codex/miniarch-step-implement-loop-state.<SESSION_ID>.json`, implement the full approved remaining frontier, and let fresh `audit-implementation` decide whether the loop is clean or more work remains. In Codex, that fresh miniarch audit child runs with `gpt-5.4-mini` at `xhigh` reasoning effort.

Use `miniarch-step` when the work needs full-arch execution but does not need `arch-step`'s broader helper surface.

### `arch-docs`

Use when the job is leaving repo docs healthier: cleaning up stale, overlapping, misleading, or obviously dated docs, updating stale survivors, clarifying confusing docs, and promoting grounded missing truth into evergreen docs. It works in any repo and, after full-arch work, uses the plan/worklog as narrowing context instead of as the whole scope.

With no extra mode, `arch-docs` runs one grounded DGTFO docs-health pass: orient to the repo's doc system, inventory doc-shaped surfaces, group them by topic, ground those topics against code, use git history when staleness or datedness matters, consolidate each topic to one canonical home, update stale surviving docs, clarify confusing docs, and add grounded missing docs when the canonical result is either a standard public-repo doc or a differentiated evergreen doc that deserves its own home. Repo posture is evidence-based: default to `private/internal` when unclear, but in `public OSS` repos treat `README`, `LICENSE*`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and `SUPPORT.md` as expected standalone docs. Then delete stale, duplicate, or dated one-off truth and repair links or nav for the surviving docs.

`arch-docs auto` is the Codex-only hook-backed controller for repeated docs-cleanup passes. The user-facing command is still just `Use $arch-docs auto`. It is real only when `~/.codex/hooks.json` contains the repo-managed `Stop` entry pointing at `~/.agents/skills/arch-step/scripts/arch_controller_stop_hook.py` and `codex_hooks` is enabled. Otherwise it must fail loud instead of pretending prompt-only looping is enough.

For any of these Codex auto controllers, do not run the Stop hook yourself. After the controller is armed, just end the turn and let Codex run the installed Stop hook.

### `arch-mini-plan`

Use when the task still needs canonical arch blocks, but the planning should be done in one pass and follow-through should happen later via `miniarch-step` or `arch-step`, then `arch-docs` for later docs cleanup.

### `lilarch`

Use for contained features or improvements that should fit in 1-3 phases.

### `bugs-flow`

Use for Sentry/log-driven bug analysis, narrow fixes, and explicit-review-only follow-up.

### `audit-loop`

Use for repo-wide audit passes where the agent should exhaustively map the codebase and current proof surface before editing, then rank and attack the biggest real unresolved risks by consequence instead of picking something convenient. Every editful pass must then audit its own diff for safety, downstream consequences, elegance, and duplication before it can count as done.

### `comment-loop`

Use for repo-wide code comment hardening passes where the agent should exhaustively map the repo, current proof surface, and current explanatory coverage before editing, then rank and attack the biggest shared explanation gaps around contracts, conventions, gotchas, and subtle behavior instead of writing narration wherever it feels helpful.

### `audit-loop-sim`

Use for repo-wide real-app automation passes where the agent should exhaustively map the app, journeys, and current automation surface before editing, then rank and attack the biggest unresolved automation risks by consequence instead of cashing out on tiny safe test tweaks. Every editful pass must then audit its own diff for safety, downstream consequences, elegance, and duplication before it can count as done.

### `delay-poll`

Use when the user wants Codex to wait on some external condition, re-check it every 30 minutes, every hour, or similar, and continue the same visible thread only after that condition becomes true.

### `goal-loop`

Use when the goal is clear but the path is not, and you want a controller doc plus append-only iteration log.

### `north-star-investigation`

Use for quantified investigations where ranked hypotheses and brutal tests are the main job.

### `arch-flow`

Use when the question is "what's next?" on an arch-style doc and you want the single best read-only recommendation.

### `arch-skills-guide`

Use when the question is "which arch skill should I use?" or "what is the difference between these live subskills?"

### `agent-definition-auditor`

Use when the user wants a cold-read score, rationale, and prioritized improvements for an `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `SKILL.md`, `SOUL.md`, system prompt, or other agent-definition markdown.

### `amir-publish`

Use when Amir wants to publish this skills repo across his usual machines: commit and push the current local work, run `make install` locally, then SSH to the fixed host list, skip the current host, pull the same branch from the same directory, and run `make install` remotely.

## Usage

- Primary surface: ask the agent to use `arch-step`, `arch-docs`, `arch-mini-plan`, `lilarch`, `bugs-flow`, `audit-loop`, `comment-loop`, `audit-loop-sim`, `delay-poll`, `goal-loop`, `north-star-investigation`, `arch-flow`, `arch-skills-guide`, `agent-definition-auditor`, or `amir-publish`.
- Full-arch execution defaults to `miniarch-step` when the trimmed command surface is enough and `arch-step` when the broader or helper-heavy surface is needed.
- Docs cleanup loops default to `arch-docs`.
- Read-only checklist and next-step inspection uses `arch-flow`.
