# arch_skill (Codex CLI prompts)

This repo is a set of **Codex custom prompts** (slash commands) plus a small HTML template used by some prompts.

In addition, it includes an optional **Codex skill** (`arch-skill`) that acts as a router + invariants layer (single SSOT doc, question policy, flow selection). The skill is a **parallel mechanism**: prompts are still installed and used as-is.

## Install

```bash
@channel

git clone git@github.com:aelaguiz/arch_skill.git
cd arch_skill
make install
```

This installs:
- Prompts → `~/.codex/prompts/`
- Templates → `~/.codex/templates/arch_skill/`
- Skills:
  - `arch-skill` → `~/.codex/skills/arch-skill/`
  - `arch-flow` → `~/.codex/skills/arch-flow/`

Note: prompts use a `USERNAME` placeholder. `make install` creates a `.env` file (if missing), ensures it contains `USERNAME=<whoami>`, then substitutes that value into the installed prompts. Edit `.env` to override.

Restart your Codex instance so it reloads the installed prompts/skill.

## Usage

- Start typing `/prompts:` in Codex CLI and pick the command you want (`arch-new`, `arch-mini-plan-agent`, `arch-implement`, etc.).
- Optional: in conversation, you can ask Codex to “use arch-skill” to activate the router + invariants layer (prompts remain the SSOT procedures).
- Optional (high leverage when you have specs/design docs you don’t want missed): `/prompts:arch-fold-in`
  - Example: `/prompts:arch-fold-in docs/MY_PLAN.md docs/spec.md docs/ux_notes.md https://… "Fold these in; Phase 2 must obey the UX contract."`
- Shortcut for “run automation on an existing sim/emulator and reopen plan issues if it fails”: `/prompts:arch-qa-autotest`
- Regular flow vs mini flow guide: `docs/arch_skill_usage_guide.md`
