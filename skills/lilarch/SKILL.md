# Lilarch

Use this skill for contained feature work that is too small for the full arch flow but still benefits from a real doc-backed plan.

## When to use

- The change is a small feature or improvement.
- The work should fit in 1-3 phases.
- The user wants the "little arch" workflow rather than the full arch plan.

## When not to use

- The task is a migration, a broad refactor, or clearly larger than 3 phases.
- The user wants a compressed one-pass arch plan instead of a start/plan/finish flow. Use `arch-mini-plan`.
- The user wants the full arch workflow or the doc already behaves like a full-arch artifact. Use `arch-step`.
- Investigation dominates because the root cause is unknown. Use `bugs-flow` or `north-star-investigation`.

## Non-negotiables

- Keep one compact `DOC_PATH` as the SSOT for the change.
- Start and plan modes are docs-only. Code changes only happen in finish mode.
- Ask the small set of clarifying questions that must be answered before planning. Do not bulldoze past unresolved requirements.
- Keep the plan to 1-3 phases. If it grows beyond that, escalate instead of pretending the fit is still good.
- Implementation stays local. Do not launch external review unless the user explicitly asks for review.
- When the changed behavior is agent- or LLM-driven, inspect prompt surfaces, native model capabilities, and existing tool/file/context exposure before designing.
- For agent-backed systems, prefer prompt engineering, grounding, and native-capability use before new harnesses, wrappers, parsers, OCR layers, or scripts.
- If the real lever is prompt repair, say so plainly and recommend `prompt-authoring` instead of inventing deterministic scaffolding.
- No runtime fallbacks or compatibility shims unless explicitly approved in the doc.
- Escalation out of lilarch defaults to `arch-step reformat` so the same doc can continue under the full-arch surface.

## First move

1. Read `references/doc-contract.md`.
2. Read `references/shared-doctrine.md`.
3. Resolve whether you are in:
   - start mode
   - plan mode
   - finish mode
4. Resolve `DOC_PATH` and read it fully if it exists.
5. Check that the work still fits `lilarch`.
6. Read the mode reference and `references/quality-bar.md`.

## Workflow

### 1) Start mode

- Create or repair the compact plan doc.
- Draft the North Star, requirements, non-requirements, defaults, and the small list of clarifying questions.
- Stop for answers if those questions are required to plan safely.

### 2) Plan mode

- Update the minimal research grounding.
- Write the current architecture, target architecture, call-site audit, and a 1-3 phase plan.
- Run the internal lilarch plan audit and tighten the doc before implementation.

### 3) Finish mode

- Implement locally against the doc.
- Keep a lightweight `WORKLOG_PATH`.
- Self-audit for completeness and mark the doc complete only when the code is actually complete.

## Output expectations

- Update `DOC_PATH` in every mode.
- Update `WORKLOG_PATH` during finish mode.
- Keep the console summary short and practical:
  - North Star reminder
  - punchline
  - what changed
  - blockers or remaining questions
  - next action

## Reference map

- `references/doc-contract.md` - lilarch artifact, required blocks, status rules, worklog, and escalation rules
- `references/shared-doctrine.md` - small-feature doctrine, question policy, and anti-fallback rules
- `references/start.md` - create or repair the compact doc and lock requirements/defaults
- `references/plan.md` - write the compact architecture blocks and 1-3 phase plan
- `references/finish.md` - implement, keep the worklog honest, and self-audit
- `references/quality-bar.md` - strong vs weak requirements, plan, plan audit, and finish-mode completion bars
