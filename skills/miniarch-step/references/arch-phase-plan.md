# `phase-plan` Command Contract

## What this command does

- write or sharpen the authoritative phased implementation plan
- convert architecture and audit material into execution order
- keep the phase plan as the one execution checklist

## Shared references to carry in

- `artifact-contract.md`
- `shared-doctrine.md`
- `../../_shared/scope-and-convergence.md`
- `../../_shared/depth-first-planning.md`
- `section-quality.md` for Sections 5, 6, 7, and 8

## Reads for alignment

- `# TL;DR`
- `# 0) Holistic North Star`
- `# 5) Target Architecture`
- `# 6) Call-Site Audit`
- `planning_passes`

## Writes

- `# 7) Depth-First Phased Implementation Plan (authoritative)`
- `arch_skill:block:phase_plan`

## Hard rules

- docs-only; do not modify code
- if the North Star, requested behavior scope, allowed architectural convergence scope, or any other plan-shaping decision is contradictory, stop and ask the exact blocker question
- map every required item to human-authorized scope or the initial
  architecture's recorded minimal convergence closure; repo truth alone does
  not authorize more work
- if adjacent-surface disposition or compatibility posture is still unresolved, stop and ask instead of hiding the fork in Section 7
- read the Scope and Simplicity Contract before extracting work; if human
  anchors or the convergence closure are missing or vague, repair Section 0 and
  reconfirm it before writing an implementation-ready phase plan
- at implementation readiness, record the closure or explicit `none`, set the
  scope-freeze boundary, and keep observations out of the execution checklist
- before a phase is valid, run an obligation sweep across Section 5, Section 6, migration notes, delete lists, verification commitments, docs/comments propagation, approved bridge removal, and any helper-added ship-blocking work
- every required obligation from that sweep must be represented in `Checklist (must all be done)` or `Exit criteria (all required)`; do not leave standalone required work only in `Work`, `Verification`, `Docs/comments`, migration prose, or surrounding narrative
- for agent-backed systems, prompt, grounding, and native-capability changes get first right of refusal before new harnesses, wrappers, parsers, OCR layers, or scripts
- if a phase includes new tooling for agent-backed behavior, say why prompt-first and capability-first options were insufficient
- do not add scripts, tests, CI checks, or validation steps whose primary job is auditing docs/help, checking keyword absence, policing repo layout, or proving deletions by grep
- only ship-blocking work belongs in the authoritative checklist
- every checklist item and exit criterion must directly serve `Smallest sufficient fix` or `Enough proof`; remove anything that serves neither
- match implementation and proof to the demonstrated failure and blast radius; a systemic fix should act at the narrowest shared boundary, not expand one incident into a general-purpose subsystem
- test the demonstrated failure, successful path, and most important boundary regression; add more only for a distinct, demonstrated risk
- if the change would leave touched live docs, comments, or instructions stale, update-or-delete work for those surfaces belongs in the phase plan
- do not assume backward compatibility by default; the phase plan must encode the chosen preservation, clean-cutover, or approved-bridge story explicitly
- do not turn helper blocks into competing execution checklists
- do not leave the authoritative checklist holding unresolved branches, `if needed` work, or alternative execution paths
- split Section 7 into a depth-first sequence: protect the full destination map, prove the first real working slice through the canonical owner path and highest-risk seam, then expand along named axes
- earlier phases should establish proof gates that later phases can rely on; "fundamental" means risk-bearing seam, owner path, contract, prompt surface, migration posture, or verification shape, not an unused foundation layer
- phase count is an outcome, not a target; split only when a phase blends separately provable units, and merge units that prove nothing until combined
- `Work` explains the coherent unit; for modern docs it is explanatory only and must not carry standalone obligations
- `Checklist` is the exhaustive must-do list inside that phase
- `Exit criteria` must name the exhaustive concrete done-state that auditing will validate, not summary vibes or restated goals
- a phase is not complete on paper unless every checklist item and every exit criterion is satisfied

## Warn-first preflight

Before writing the phase plan:

- inspect `planning_passes` if present
- otherwise infer from research and deep-dive content
- if recommended sequencing is incomplete or unknown, do not stop
- instead warn clearly and continue writing the plan

## Quality bar

- Section 7 must stay the one authoritative execution checklist
- the plan must preserve the destination map while building depth-first
- the first working slice must be narrow but real: it proves one end-to-end path through the canonical owner path and highest-risk seam on real inputs
- later phases must name the expansion axis they widen and the proof gate that makes that widening safe
- phase count must follow proof gates, dependency edges, reversibility or migration boundaries, and user-review boundaries rather than a preset number
- each phase must have goal, work, checklist, verification, docs/comments when needed, exit criteria, and rollback
- each phase must pass an obligation sweep so required work cannot hide outside the authoritative phase-exit surface
- `Checklist` must be exhaustive enough that the implementer cannot escape required work by claiming the phase is "basically done"
- `Exit criteria` must be exhaustive, concrete, and all required
- `Work` must explain the unit without carrying standalone required obligations
- `Verification` must give a credible proof path for the phase claims, but required phase-complete truths belong in `Exit criteria`
- required docs/comments propagation, deletes, migrations, and bridge-removal work must appear in the authoritative phase-exit surface when the phase cannot be complete without them
- refactor-heavy phases must say how preserved behavior will be proven
- agent-backed phases must make capability-first choices explicit before adding custom tooling
- adjacent-surface follow-through and migration or cutover work must be visible in the relevant phases instead of being left implicit
- verification should be credible, proportionate, and non-bureaucratic
- the plan must stop at the confirmed `Enough proof` threshold instead of growing new edge-case matrices, fake environments, or verifier layers because more testing is possible
- verification must stay tied to shipped behavior, runtime ownership, or real contract boundaries rather than repo-policing heuristics
- required cleanup, deletes, and touched doc/comment reality-sync work should not be buried
- phases must name the actual chosen work to do, not conditional or alternate branches the agent would have to choose between later
- if a phase contains multiple coherent units that could be built and verified separately, split it
- weak phase plans include final-form Phase 1, fake foundations, layer-cake sequencing, preset phase count, everything-everywhere checklists, expansion treated as cut, cut hidden as expansion, or toy MVP slices

## Placement and update rules

Update in this order:

1. replace inside `arch_skill:block:phase_plan` when it exists
2. otherwise update an existing phase-plan or phased-implementation section in place, adding `arch_skill:block:phase_plan` around the authoritative phase-plan content
3. otherwise insert a new top-level Section 7 after Call-Site Audit, after Target Architecture, or after Research/Problem sections

If the doc is canonical, preserve exact Section 7 heading and numbering.
Every successful `phase-plan` run must leave `<!-- arch_skill:block:phase_plan:start -->` and `<!-- arch_skill:block:phase_plan:end -->` around the authoritative phase plan. Updating a markerless section in place preserves its position and repaired content; it does not leave the marker absent.

Use this block shape:

```text
<!-- arch_skill:block:phase_plan:start -->
# Depth-First Phased Implementation Plan (authoritative)

> Rule: depth-first implementation protects the frozen destination while proving the path early. The destination map is the human-authorized outcome plus the initial minimal convergence closure recorded before implementation and any later explicit human approval. The expansion map only sequences that frozen breadth; workers and reviewers cannot add callers, variants, modes, guarantees, proof categories, or adjacent cleanup. Section 7 chooses the first working slice through the canonical owner path and highest-risk seam, then advances through already-authorized axes. Phase boundaries are proof gates, and phase count follows real dependency, proof, reversibility, migration, or user-review boundaries. `Work` is explanatory; `Checklist (must all be done)` and `Exit criteria (all required)` hold every required obligation. Refactors and consolidations preserve behavior with proportionate evidence. Prefer prompt, grounding, and native capability before new agent tooling. No fallback or runtime shim exists without explicit approval and removal work. Prefer focused programmatic checks, defer manual/UI verification to finalization, and avoid deletion proofs, visual constants, doc gates, keyword/absence gates, and repo-shape policing.

## Phase 1 — <most fundamental coherent unit>

* Goal:
* Work:
* Checklist (must all be done):
* Verification (required proof):
* Docs/comments (propagation; only if needed):
* Exit criteria (all required):
* Rollback:

## Phase N — <next coherent unit built on earlier phases>

* Goal:
* Work:
* Checklist (must all be done):
* Verification (required proof):
* Docs/comments (propagation; only if needed):
* Exit criteria (all required):
* Rollback:
<!-- arch_skill:block:phase_plan:end -->
```

Use `Work` to describe the coherent unit and why it is isolated in that phase. For modern docs, do not hide standalone obligations there. Use `Checklist` for the exhaustive required actions inside that unit. Use `Exit criteria` for the exhaustive concrete done-state that auditing must validate. If a planned item could be left undone while the phase still sounds "basically complete," or if a phase-complete truth appears only in prose, the phase is underspecified and should be split or tightened.
If the change spans a contract family or migration boundary, encode the chosen adjacent-surface follow-through and the chosen cutover, preservation, or approved-bridge work directly in the relevant phase instead of leaving that choice implicit.
Before finalizing Section 7, reread every checklist item and exit criterion
against the Scope and Simplicity Contract. Delete any item that serves neither
the human outcome, frozen initial closure, nor enough proof. After freeze, stop
for human approval instead of writing a new adjacent path into the plan.
Use `Docs/comments` to explain live docs/comments propagation. If deleting or rewriting those surfaces is required for the phase to be complete, also represent that required work in `Checklist` or `Exit criteria`. Do not keep legacy explanation in live surfaces just because Git already preserves the old version.

## Consistency duties beyond local ownership

- if the phase plan changes sequencing, the pre-freeze convergence closure, or
  verification expectations, repair stale claims in TL;DR, Section 0, and
  Section 8; any post-freeze expansion beyond the Scope and Simplicity Contract
  requires explicit human approval first
- if new sequencing or scope decisions replace an earlier assumption, append or update Section 10
- Section 7 must remain the one execution checklist even after helper blocks exist

## Stop condition

- if the doc path remains truly ambiguous after best effort, ask the user to choose from the top 2-3 candidates
- if the North Star, requested behavior scope, allowed architectural convergence scope, or any phase-shaping decision is contradictory or unresolved, stop and ask the exact blocker question
- otherwise stop after the authoritative phase plan is updated and any warn-first caveats are surfaced

## Console contract

- one-line North Star reminder
- one-line punchline
- what changed in the phase plan
- warn about missing earlier passes when relevant
- next action
