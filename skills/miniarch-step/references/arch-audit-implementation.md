# `audit-implementation` Command Contract

## What this command does

- verify whether the code really satisfies the plan
- reopen false-complete phases when code work is missing
- distinguish missing code from manual verification that is not code proof
- update the main artifact with evidence-anchored audit findings
- serve as the audit pass used directly or inside `implement-loop`

## Audit North Star

After this command runs:

- the plan doc reflects reality
- false-complete phases are reopened
- missing code work is explicit and evidence-anchored
- manual verification remains visible without softening code-completeness
- a reader can tell whether the implementation is actually code-complete without hand-waving

## Shared references to carry in

- `artifact-contract.md`
- `shared-doctrine.md`
- `../../_shared/agent-orchestration-policy.md` when the audit is dispatched to an independent child
- `../../_shared/scope-and-convergence.md`
- `../../_shared/depth-first-planning.md`
- `section-quality.md` for Sections 5, 6, 7, `WORKLOG_PATH`, and `implementation_audit`

## Inputs and `DOC_PATH` resolution

- treat the user ask as steering, constraints, and any relevant context
- if the ask includes a `docs/<...>.md` path, use it
- otherwise resolve `DOC_PATH` from the conversation and repo context
- if the doc path is truly ambiguous after best effort, ask the user to choose from the top 2-3 candidates

## Question policy

- answer anything discoverable from code, tests, fixtures, logs, docs, or repo tooling
- answer agent-capability questions from prompt files, runtime config, docs, or repo tooling before assuming the model cannot do something
- ask only for:
  - product or UX decisions not encoded anywhere
  - external constraints not present in the repo or doc
  - doc-path ambiguity after best effort
  - missing access or permissions
- if a question is unavoidable, state where you looked first

## Reads for alignment

- the full plan doc
- target architecture contracts
- call-site audit and delete list
- phase plan, checklist items, exit criteria, and phase status
- definition of done and evidence expectations
- worklog when present

## Writes

- `arch_skill:block:implementation_audit`
- reopened phase status lines
- `Missing (code):` notes
- `Manual Verification Pending:` notes when needed

When this command runs inside `implement-loop`, it alone owns the authoritative implementation-audit block, the `Verdict (code)` outcome, and the clean `Use $arch-docs` handoff.

## Independent child auditor

Direct invocation follows the normal writes above. When `implement-loop`
dispatches an independent auditor, the child performs the same audit reasoning
but is analysis-only: request a read-only capability when the host exposes one
and explicitly forbid edits, writes, patches, commits, or child creation. The
parent captures and rechecks repo state and remains the command owner that
integrates accepted findings into `DOC_PATH`, writes the authoritative audit
block, and reopens phases.

The child returns:

- whether the bounded audit completed and its proposed `COMPLETE` or
  `NOT COMPLETE` verdict
- every material finding with file/symbol or plan-section anchors, scope
  disposition, plan expectation, code reality, and required repair or
  subtraction
- checks and searches performed, their results, and any unresolved assumptions
- manual-verification items kept separate from code blockers
- confirmation that it made no writes and created no children, plus its exact
  handle when the parent may need a bounded follow-up

The parent verifies those claims against current workspace truth before
acceptance. A later independent recheck uses a new clean auditor; a bounded
clarification of the same audit may resume the exact auditor handle.

## Communication contract

- begin work immediately when the command is clear
- do not preface with a mini-plan or restate the ask
- keep console output short and high-signal
- put exhaustive detail in `DOC_PATH`, not in console output

## Hard rules

- docs-only; do not modify code
- code is ground truth
- this is a code-completeness audit, not a bureaucracy audit
- missing manual verification evidence is not code proof and should not by
  itself reopen phases
- missing tests, assertions, migrations, generated artifacts, docs/prompt
  truth, side-door closure, preservation proof, or required deletes are
  code-verifiable gaps when the plan requires them; do not classify them as
  manual verification
- do not fix the code while auditing; record gaps instead
- when running inside `implement-loop`, do not let the parent implementation pass stand in for this audit or author the authoritative clean outcome
- if the implementation claims a fix but does not provide credible code-verifiable proof for it, treat that as missing code completeness
- audit against the approved plan's explicit promises, not against a narrower story execution wrote after the fact
- audit implementation shape against the original human anchors, frozen initial
  closure, and explicit later human approvals, not only against whether the
  latest plan was built
- audit against the current approved ordered implementation frontier, not just the first visible local gap
- a named later expansion is not missing current code until its proof gate is due
- silent removal from the destination map, approved scope, checklist, exit criteria, or named expansion map is still a scope cut
- if execution rewrote requirements, scope, acceptance criteria, or phase obligations to make unfinished work disappear, treat that as `NOT COMPLETE`
- for modern Section 7 docs, `Checklist (must all be done)` and `Exit criteria (all required)` are jointly authoritative phase-exit surfaces; `Work` is explanatory only
- do not accept "mostly done", "core path done", or similar broad completion claims when explicit plan details or sub-obligations are still missing
- broader docs consolidation, evergreen promotion, and plan/worklog retirement belong to `arch-docs` after a clean audit unless the plan explicitly made a specific touched-doc cleanup item part of code-completeness

## Highest-bar audit criteria

Check all of these:

- absolute completeness:
  - if the plan says something is done, it is actually built
  - if the plan promises a checklist item, exit criterion, detail, sub-obligation, migration, delete, cleanup, or proof item, it is actually satisfied
  - if a modern phase strands required obligations outside `Checklist` or `Exit criteria`, do not treat that phase as honestly complete
- architecture compliance:
  - SSOT is real
  - boundaries and contracts match the plan
  - required deletes and cleanup happened
  - touched live docs, comments, and instructions that the plan said to update or delete no longer contradict shipped reality
  - for agent-backed systems, implementation did not replace prompt/native-capability work with unjustified scaffolding
  - no forbidden shims slipped in
  - no new parallel path or duplicate writer was introduced
  - no unauthorized adjacent work, framework, harness, verifier, abstraction,
    command, dependency, operational surface, or test category exceeded the
    Scope and Simplicity Contract
  - the fix and proof surface remain proportional to the demonstrated failure and blast radius
- idiomatic fit:
  - implementation aligns with existing repo patterns unless the plan justified divergence
- behavior preservation:
  - required refactors or consolidations have credible evidence that behavior was preserved
- fix proof:
  - claimed behavior-changing fixes have credible code-verifiable proof, not just changed files
- call-site completeness:
  - every call site that should have migrated actually migrated

## Evidence split

Split plan evidence expectations into two buckets before judging completeness:

- code-verifiable evidence:
  - code paths
  - call-site migrations
  - deletes and cleanup
  - refactor-preservation checks
  - tests, build signals, instrumentation, assertions, or other programmatic evidence
- manual evidence:
  - screenshots
  - manual QA passes
  - human validation checklists

Only missing code-verifiable evidence can make the audit verdict `NOT COMPLETE`.
Missing manual evidence should become `Manual Verification Pending`.

## Audit procedure

1. read `DOC_PATH` fully
2. extract the plan's authoritative anchors:
   - explicit requirements, exclusions, and acceptance criteria
   - target architecture contracts, APIs, names, and paths
   - call-site audit rows or equivalent migration inventory
   - phase plan, checklist items, exit criteria, and any phases marked complete, done, or checked off
   - delete list and cleanup expectations
   - live docs/comments/instructions cleanup expectations in touched areas
   - definition-of-done evidence expectations
   - the Scope and Simplicity Contract: human anchors, frozen initial closure,
     smallest sufficient solution, enough proof, and do-not-build boundary
3. split evidence expectations into:
   - code-verifiable evidence
   - manual verification evidence
4. validate each planned code change against repo reality:
   - when a phase has `Checklist (must all be done)` and `Exit criteria (all required)`, treat both as authoritative for that phase; use `Work` bullets only for legacy docs that predate the checklist field
   - if a modern phase still carries required obligations only in `Work`, `Verification`, `Docs/comments`, migration notes, delete lists, or helper narration, record that as a planning-integrity gap and do not let the phase stand as complete
   - verify the implementation did not weaken or rewrite the plan to hide unfinished work
   - verify every explicit requirement, checklist item, exit criterion, and sub-obligation in the plan, not just the main happy path
   - verify each planned call-site change in code
   - search for missed call sites or lingering old APIs, patterns, or paths
   - verify SSOT ownership and boundary compliance in shipped code, runtime routing, or real contract surfaces
   - verify the implementation converged onto the planned canonical path instead of introducing a bypass
   - verify required deletes and cleanup through repo search, static analysis, build, or typecheck rather than proof tests
   - verify touched live docs, comments, and instructions were deleted or rewritten when the plan said they would otherwise become stale
   - for agent-backed systems, verify planned prompt, grounding, or native-capability changes actually landed when they were the primary lever
   - verify any new harness, wrapper, parser, OCR layer, or script was explicitly justified by the plan instead of silently replacing intended model reasoning
   - do not treat missing docs-audit scripts, keyword greps, absence checks, or repo-policing CI as missing code work unless the user explicitly asked for that tooling class
   - verify required preservation signals actually ran and protect the intended behavior
   - verify claimed fixes have credible code-verifiable proof instead of only a code diff
   - verify claimed tests, assertions, or automation actually exist and hit the intended failure surface
   - compare new production concepts, code paths, operational steps, harnesses,
     and test categories against the frozen Scope and Simplicity Contract
   - if implementation exceeds that contract without an explicit human approval
     anchor, record subtraction as missing code correctness even when it passes;
     an agent-authored Decision Log entry is not approval
   - verify testing stops at the demonstrated failure, successful path, important boundary regression, and any additional distinct demonstrated risks rather than modeling every imaginable failure
5. determine phase truth:
   - if a phase is marked complete but any checklist item, exit criterion, required proof, or other required code work is missing, reopen it
   - if implementation stopped after one local win while later approved phases due in the current frontier remain unfinished, treat that remaining frontier as missing code work
   - if code is complete but manual QA is pending, do not reopen it
6. write the audit block and any required in-place phase updates

Always name phases as `Phase <n> (<what it does>)` using the phase heading text when available.

## False-complete rules

- reopen a phase only for missing or incorrect code work
- do not reopen a phase solely because screenshots, manual QA, or human verification are still pending
- if the plan says an old path should be deleted, removed, or unreachable, treat that as code work and audit it accordingly
- if the plan says a touched live doc, comment, or instruction should be deleted or rewritten, treat that as implementation work and audit it accordingly
- if the implementation introduced a forbidden shim, fallback, or parallel source of truth, treat that as missing code correctness and reopen the responsible phase
- if the implementation introduced capability-replacing scaffolding for agent-backed behavior without explicit plan justification, treat that as missing code correctness and reopen the responsible phase
- if implementation introduced adjacent work, machinery, or disproportional
  proof beyond the frozen contract without explicit human approval, treat
  removal or simplification as missing code correctness and reopen the phase
- a new same-contract path discovered by audit may block approval, but audit
  cannot add it to repair scope; require a human decision and re-freeze
- if a refactor or convergence change lacks credible preservation evidence, treat that as missing code correctness and reopen the responsible phase
- if a claimed fix lacks credible code-verifiable proof, treat that as missing code correctness and reopen the responsible phase
- if an exit criterion is unmet, too vague to validate honestly, or lacks the proof needed to support it, treat that as missing code correctness and reopen the responsible phase
- if required work is stranded outside the authoritative phase-exit surface in a modern doc, treat that as missing code correctness and reopen the responsible phase
- if execution-side plan edits weakened requirements, scope, acceptance criteria, or phase obligations to match partial code, treat that as missing code correctness and reopen the responsible phase
- if missing work spans later phases due in the current frontier, reopen the remaining ordered frontier instead of emitting a one-gap-at-a-time partial reopening
- do not reopen a phase solely because someone failed to add a keyword grep, docs-audit script, absence check, or repo-structure policing gate that the user never asked for

## Update rules

Write or update:

- `arch_skill:block:implementation_audit`

Use this block shape:

```text
<!-- arch_skill:block:implementation_audit:start -->
# Implementation Audit (authoritative)
Date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
Verdict (code): <COMPLETE|NOT COMPLETE>
Manual Verification: <pending|complete|n/a>

## Code blockers (why code is not done)
- <bullets only about missing or incorrect code>

## Reopened phases (false-complete fixes)
- Phase <n> (<what it does>) — reopened because:
  - <missing items>

## Missing items (code gaps; evidence-anchored; no tables)
- <area>
  - Evidence anchors:
    - <path:line>
  - Plan expects:
    - <expected>
  - Code reality:
    - <actual>
  - Fix:
    - <fix>

## Manual verification pending (screenshots / human validation)
- <follow-up item>
<!-- arch_skill:block:implementation_audit:end -->
```

Placement rule:

1. if `arch_skill:block:implementation_audit` already exists, replace inside it
2. otherwise insert the block after `# TL;DR`
3. if no TL;DR exists, insert after frontmatter
4. if no frontmatter exists, insert at the top

If code work is missing, update the affected phase in place with:

- `Status: REOPENED (audit found missing code work)`
- `Missing (code):`

If only manual QA is pending:

- do not reopen the phase
- add or update `Manual Verification Pending:`

When reopening a phase:

- use the phase heading text so the reopened phase is human-readable
- keep the missing-code list concrete and anchored to files, symbols, deletes, or tests
- do not erase prior truthful completion notes; correct them with the reopened status

## Verdict rules

- `Verdict (code): COMPLETE` only when no missing or incorrect code work remains
- `Verdict (code): NOT COMPLETE` when any required code work, migration,
  delete, touched-doc cleanup, runtime or code contract expectation,
  preservation expectation, anti-shim expectation, or required subtraction
  back to the Scope and Simplicity Contract is unmet
- manual QA pending alone does not force `NOT COMPLETE`
- a later `arch-docs` cleanup pass is expected after a clean verdict; that broader docs-cleanup work is not by itself a reason to keep `Verdict (code): NOT COMPLETE`

## Stop condition

- if the doc path remains truly ambiguous after best effort, ask the user to choose from the top 2-3 candidates
- otherwise stop after the audit block and any necessary phase reopenings or manual-QA notes are written

## Console contract

- one-line North Star reminder
- one-line punchline
- what the audit found and what changed in the doc
- real blockers or risks
- next action, which is `Use $arch-docs` when the code verdict is clean and the surviving docs still need cleanup, consolidation, or plan/worklog retirement
