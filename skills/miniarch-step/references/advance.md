# `advance` Command Contract

## What this command does

- inspect one canonical full-arch artifact end to end
- emit the full ordered checklist with evidence notes
- choose exactly one next move
- optionally execute only that one next step when `RUN=1`

## Shared references to carry in

- `artifact-contract.md`
- `shared-doctrine.md`
- `section-quality.md`
- `status.md`

## Inputs and mode

- resolve `DOC_PATH` using the normal `miniarch-step` defaults
- optional `RUN=1`:
  - default behavior is recommend only
  - with `RUN=1`, execute exactly one chosen next command when that move still belongs to `miniarch-step`

## What `advance` inspects first

Inspect the same artifact surfaces as `status`:

- required frontmatter
- `# TL;DR`
- `planning_passes`
- `# 0) Holistic North Star`
- exact canonical top-level sections `# 1)` through `# 10)`
- required command-owned blocks
- `WORKLOG_PATH` and `implementation_audit` when implementation has started

## Checklist statuses

Use exactly:

- `[DONE]`
- `[PENDING]`
- `[UNKNOWN]`

Rules:

- required stages are `[DONE]` only when the artifact is strong enough to proceed without guesswork or unresolved decisions
- weak or missing required stages are `[PENDING]`
- use `[UNKNOWN]` only when the artifact genuinely does not let you determine the answer
- every line must include a short evidence note

## Ordered checklist

Emit every line in this order:

1. Plan artifact exists and is canonical enough to trust
2. North Star is confirmed and strong enough to plan against
3. Research grounding is present and credible
4. Deep dive is complete enough to trust current architecture, target architecture, and call-site audit
5. The authoritative phase plan is present and execution-grade
6. Implementation progress is grounded in code, `DOC_PATH`, and `WORKLOG_PATH`
7. Implementation audit is present and honest
8. Docs cleanup is either clearly next or already retired from the live surface

## Evidence model

- use `status.md` for artifact grading and stage evidence rules
- turn those grades into checklist states:
  - `strong` or trustworthy `decent` -> `[DONE]`
  - `weak` or `missing` on required stages -> `[PENDING]`
- for deep dive, call out whether the single pass is done using `planning_passes`
- for implementation, require both doc truth and worklog truth before calling it `[DONE]`
- treat missing canonical-path analysis or missing preservation verification as real weakness, not optional polish
- treat unresolved plan-shaping decisions as `[PENDING]`, even when the surrounding section is otherwise strong

## Next-command selection rule

Choose exactly one next move using this precedence:

1. no plan doc yet -> `new`
2. existing doc is not canonical enough to trust -> `reformat`
3. North Star is still draft or too weak -> stop for confirmation or repair via `reformat`
4. after North Star confirmation, stop and wait for the user's explicit next command; do not auto-advance into `research` or any later stage
5. unresolved decision gap remains that repo truth cannot settle -> ask the user the exact blocker question
6. earliest required structure or owned block is missing -> run the command that repairs it
7. required structure exists but the next critical sections are still weak, including canonical-path analysis, preservation verification, or decision-completeness -> run the command that strengthens them
8. otherwise follow the core arc:
   - `research`
   - `deep-dive`
   - `phase-plan`
   - `implement` by default
   - `implement-loop` when the user explicitly wants the full-frontier delivery loop to a clean audit
   - `audit-implementation`
9. if the code audit is clean and the feature still needs docs cleanup, hand off to `Use $arch-docs`
10. if all required stages are complete and the live feature residue is already retired, say there is no required next move

## `RUN=1` execution rule

When `RUN=1` is present:

- print the checklist and chosen next move first
- then load the matching internal command reference from `references/`
- execute only that one command against the same artifact when the next move is still a `miniarch-step` command
- do not chain into a second command
- if the next move is a blocker question or North Star confirmation rather than a command, stop and ask instead of mutating further
- if the next move is `arch-docs`, print the handoff and stop; do not silently auto-switch skills from inside `advance`

## Output shape

- one-line North Star reminder
- one-line punchline naming the next move
- `DOC_PATH`
- the full checklist with evidence notes
- the exact next invocation
- if the next move is a blocker question, print that exact question instead of an invocation
- if `RUN=1` is absent, offer the next move without executing it
- if `RUN=1` is present, execute the chosen `miniarch-step` command and stop after that command finishes
