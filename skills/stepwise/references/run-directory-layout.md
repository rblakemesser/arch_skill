# Run directory layout

One invocation of the skill creates one run directory. The directory holds
everything needed to audit the run after the fact: the user's verbatim
instructions, the confirmed manifest, each step's subprocess output, each
critic's verdict, and the final report.

## Location

```
<orchestrator_repo_root>/.arch_skill/stepwise/runs/<run-id>/
```

`<run-id>` is `<UTC-iso-timestamp>-<8-char-hash>`, where the hash is the
first 8 hex characters of `sha256(raw_instructions + target_repo_path)`.
This gives a human-readable sort order and per-user collision safety.

The orchestrator repo root is the cwd when the skill was invoked. Do not
write run artifacts into the target repo — the target repo is where the
steps produce their real outputs; the run directory is orchestration
bookkeeping.

Add `.arch_skill/` to the orchestrator repo's `.gitignore` on first write
if not already present.

```

`raw_instructions_sha256` and `execution_sha256` pin the orchestrator's
interpretation. If either changes during the run, the run is aborted and
restarted — no silent rewriting mid-flight. (Same discipline as arch-loop's
`raw_requirements_hash`.)

Older local invocations may still pass `--models-json` to `init-run`; the
script converts that legacy input into `execution` before writing state.
New run directories should not contain top-level `models` or `models_sha256`.

## Per-step try directory

Every attempt gets its own try directory, even if the prior try was a pass
(which shouldn't happen, but guards against accidental re-runs). Structure
is flat — no nesting beyond what is listed. `try-1` is the initial attempt,
`try-2` is the first resume, and so on.

`invocation.sh` is a reproducible shell script — one line that would
re-run the subprocess exactly. This is what an auditor uses to reproduce a
suspicious run without re-launching the orchestrator.

`session_id.txt` contains one line: the session id (Claude) or thread_id
(Codex). Downstream tries read this file to construct their resume command.

## report.md

Short, human-readable. Example skeleton:

```
# stepwise run report

Run: 2026-04-22T18-30-02Z-8ab0c1de
Target: /Users/aelaguiz/workspace/lessons_studio
Process: Track 3 / Section 3 / Lesson 2
Profile: strict (forced: skill_order_adherence, no_fabrication)

## Steps

| # | Label                                   | Status             | Tries |
|---|------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------|
| 1 | Ramp up on track 3 / section 3 context   | pass               | 1     |
| 2 | Draft lesson 2 outline                   | pass-after-retry   | 2     |
| 3 | Fill lesson 2 body                       | pass               | 1     |

## Execution

| # | Step runtime | Step model | Step effort | Critic runtime | Critic model | Critic effort |
|---|--------------|------------|-------------|----------------|--------------|---------------|
| 1 | codex        | gpt-5.4    | high        | codex          | gpt-5.4-mini | xhigh         |
| 2 | claude       | opus-4-7   | high        | codex          | gpt-5.4-mini | xhigh         |

## Notable critic findings

Step 2, try 1: FAIL on `artifact_exists`. The step claimed to write
outline.md but the file was absent. Resumed; try 2 wrote the file and
passed.

## Status

completed
```

If `halted`, the report names the halted step, the final verdict, and
what the user would need to decide to unblock.

When at least one upstream repair happened during the run (i.e., a
critic set `route_to_step_n` on a fail and `stop_discipline` was
`autonomous_repair`), include a `## Repairs` section naming each
reopening:

```
## Repairs

- Step 3 reopened from step 4's finding: <headline from step 4's
  critic rationale>
  Step 3 repaired; steps 4+ re-ran fresh and passed.
```

Repaired and re-run steps carry `repaired` and `pass-after-repair`
statuses in the Steps table respectively.

## Cleanup

Do not auto-delete run directories. An auditor may come back hours or
days later. If disk pressure becomes real, ship a separate prune tool —
do not entangle pruning with the orchestrator's critical path.
