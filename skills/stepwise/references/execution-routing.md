# Execution routing: resolve user preferences against real steps

Execution routing is how the orchestrator turns optional user preferences
into per-step runtime/model/effort choices. It exists so a user can say
"do all copywriting steps with Claude Opus 4.7" without forcing every step
onto that model or teaching the skill a hidden taxonomy.

Routing is a manifest-resolution step, not a script concern. The script runs
the runtime/model/effort it is given. The orchestrator decides those values
after it has drafted the real steps from target-repo doctrine.

## Inputs

- The raw user prompt.
- Target-repo doctrine and the drafted StepDescriptors.
- Base execution defaults from `model-and-effort.md`.
- Optional routing preferences extracted from user language.

## Preference shape

Each preference should preserve the user's wording and the orchestrator's
reasoning:

```json
{
  "source_quote": "all copywriting steps using Claude Opus 4.7",
  "applies_to": "steps whose primary artifact is learner-facing copy",
  "step_execution": {
    "runtime": "claude",
    "model": "opus-4-7"
  },
  "resolution_rationale": "The user named a semantic class, so resolve it against step labels, declared instructions, and expected artifacts after manifest drafting."
}
```

`step_execution` applies to worker step sessions. `critic_execution` is
optional and applies only when the user clearly says the critic should use a
different runtime/model/effort. Do not apply worker preferences to critics by
analogy.

If an override omits effort, inherit the base effort for that lane. If it
omits runtime but names a model that only belongs to one runtime family, infer
that runtime and say so in the rationale. If the runtime cannot be inferred
responsibly, ask.

## Resolution order

For each drafted step, resolve execution in this order:

1. **Runtime feasibility.** A runtime that cannot run the step is invalid.
   If the chosen CLI cannot satisfy the target doctrine or session mechanics,
   do not force it.
2. **Hard target doctrine.** If the target repo or process explicitly requires
   Claude or Codex for a step, honor that unless the user explicitly overrides
   it and accepts the conflict.
3. **Explicit step or label preference.** A user phrase like "step 4 on
   Codex" or "the copy pass on Claude" beats a broader semantic preference.
4. **Semantic category preference.** A phrase like "copywriting steps" applies
   only after comparing it to the drafted step label, instruction, inputs,
   and expected artifact.
5. **Defaults.** Use base step or critic execution defaults when no preference
   applies.

Critic execution resolves independently. The default critic runtime is the
critic default from intake; if missing, it may inherit the step runtime only
when `model-and-effort.md` says that inheritance is unambiguous.

## Matching discipline

Use all available manifest evidence:

- step label
- `skill_or_instruction`
- doctrine path for the step
- expected artifact kind and selector
- input artifacts from prior steps
- target process description

Good resolution:

- "Step 5 is `Write learner-facing hints` and produces
  `lesson-copy.json`; it matches the user's copywriting preference."
- "Step 2 is `Build playable manifest`; although it contains strings, its
  primary artifact is structural JSON, so the copywriting preference does not
  apply."

Weak resolution:

- "The word copy appears in the filename, so use Claude."
- "Claude is usually better at writing, so route copywriting to Claude even
  though the user did not ask."

## Ambiguity and conflicts

Surface unresolved routing in Phase 3 before any step executes.

Ask or pause when:

- a preference matches no drafted steps
- a preference could reasonably match several steps but the cost difference
  matters
- target doctrine requires one runtime and the user asked for another
- a model name does not identify a runtime family clearly
- applying a preference to critics would be an inference rather than an
  explicit user instruction

Do not silently ignore a preference. If it is rejected, record why in the
manifest's `execution_preferences` rationale and the Phase 3 table.

## Per-step result

Every StepDescriptor gets both resolved execution blocks:

```json
{
  "step_execution": {
    "runtime": "claude",
    "model": "opus-4-7",
    "effort": "xhigh",
    "source": "execution_preferences[0]",
    "reason": "Matched learner-facing copy artifact lesson-copy.json."
  },
  "critic_execution": {
    "runtime": "codex",
    "model": "gpt-5.4-mini",
    "effort": "xhigh",
    "source": "execution_defaults.critic",
    "reason": "No critic-specific override was provided."
  }
}
```

Repair attempts reuse the same execution block as the original step. Upstream
repairs reuse the reopened step's block. Downstream fresh re-runs use the
confirmed manifest's resolved blocks; the orchestrator does not reinterpret
the user's prompt mid-run.

## Anti-patterns

- Do not build a fixed taxonomy such as copywriting -> Claude or coding ->
  Codex.
- Do not let examples become rules. "Copywriting" is a user-supplied class in
  the example, not a permanent category.
- Do not apply worker preferences to critics unless the user clearly said so.
- Do not hide conflicts by falling back to defaults.
- Do not change model or effort because a step failed. Step failure is handled
  by the diagnose-and-repair protocol, not by changing the runtime.
