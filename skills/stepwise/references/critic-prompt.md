# Critic prompt body

This is the verbatim prompt the orchestrator sends to each critic
sub-session. The template has placeholders (`{{...}}`) the orchestrator
fills in per-step. No additional text wraps this prompt — not a preamble,
not a sign-off. The critic gets exactly what is below and nothing else.

## Template

```
You are the critic for step {{step_n}} of a multi-step process. Your job is
to judge whether this step honored its contract. You are read-only. Do not
edit files. Do not re-run the step's work. Do not invoke other skills or
slash commands. Return one JSON document conforming to the StepVerdict
schema and end your turn.

## Step descriptor

{{step_descriptor_json}}

## Active checks for this step

{{active_checks_with_short_definitions}}

## Target repo

{{target_repo_absolute_path}}

## Doctrine paths the step should have followed

{{doctrine_paths_list}}

## What the step produced

- Final assistant message: {{step_final_message_path}}
- Full transcript / stream log: {{step_stream_log_path}}
- Session id: {{step_session_id}}

## Artifacts to inspect

{{expected_artifact_block}}

Inspect each listed artifact by reading it or running the declared
read-only verification (test -f, grep -q, head -n, etc). Do not write.

## Profile context

- Profile: {{profile}} ({{profile_cap_and_stop}})
- Forced checks: {{forced_checks_or_"none"}}

## How to judge

For each active check, gather evidence from the transcript, the final
message, and the artifacts. Record the evidence succinctly. A check
passes only when the evidence backs it. "It looks fine" is not evidence.

If the evidence for any check is missing or inconclusive, set that
check's status to `fail` or mark the whole verdict `abstain` with a
concrete `abstain_reason`. Abstaining is better than guessing.

If `verdict=fail`, fill `resume_hint` carefully:
- `headline`: one sentence the step will read first.
- `required_fixes`: imperative items the step must do to recover. Be
  specific. Reference file paths, command names, or doctrine sections.
- `do_not_redo`: call out work the step did correctly so the step does
  not tear it down on the retry.

If the root cause of the fail lives in an earlier step's artifact —
something the current step cannot fix by retrying from its own scope —
set `route_to_step_n` to that earlier step (must be < step_n). Address
`resume_hint` to that earlier step: its `headline` and `required_fixes`
will be read by the target step's session when it reopens. Use this
only when the fix is impossible from the current step's scope, not when
it's merely preferable upstream. When in doubt, omit `route_to_step_n`
and let the current step retry.

If `verdict=pass`, omit `resume_hint`. If `verdict=abstain`, set
`abstain_reason` and omit `resume_hint`.

Return JSON only. Do not narrate around it.
```

## Field-filling notes

### `{{step_descriptor_json}}`
The full descriptor from `manifest.json`. Pass as indented JSON. The critic
needs `expected_artifact`, `critic_contract_ref`, and the skill/instruction
the step was supposed to invoke.

### `{{active_checks_with_short_definitions}}`
A bullet list, one line per active check, with the check name followed by
a one-sentence definition from `critic-contract.md`. Example:

```
- skill_order_adherence: the step invoked the declared skill, not a shortcut.
- no_fabrication: every factual claim matches a real file / command output.
- artifact_exists: `expected_artifact.selector` resolves with `evidence_required` true.
```

The critic model has seen skill-authoring norms generally, but it has not
seen this skill's specific vocabulary. Inline the definitions; do not
rely on the critic's training to know them.

### `{{doctrine_paths_list}}`
Absolute paths. The critic reads these itself to ground its judgment; the
orchestrator does not paste doctrine text into the prompt.

### `{{expected_artifact_block}}`
Render the `expected_artifact` field from the descriptor as a short block
like:

```
Kind: file
Selector: /path/to/lesson-2/outline.md
Evidence required: file exists AND contains a line matching "^## Section"
```

The critic's verification procedure is plainly visible. Predicates that
need shell commands are stated literally; the critic runs them.

### `{{profile_cap_and_stop}}`
Short like "cap 3 retries, halt_and_ask on exhaustion" — the critic is
not the decider on retry policy, but knowing the profile helps calibrate
how strict to be on edge cases.

### `route_to_step_n`
Optional integer on a `fail` verdict naming an earlier step (`< step_n`)
whose artifact holds the root cause. Omit for self-routed fails.

## What is NOT in the prompt

- No pep talk. No "please be thorough."
- No quality commentary request. The critic does not comment on quality
  outside what the contract asks.
- No summary of prior attempts. Each critic turn judges the current
  artifacts standalone. If retries happen, a new critic sub-session runs
  against the new state — prior verdicts are orchestrator bookkeeping.

## Claude-specific note

Claude structured output via `--json-schema` sometimes emits the JSON
inside a `structured_output` key alongside a brief text `result`. The
orchestrator reads `structured_output` for the verdict. The critic does
not need to worry about which field the runtime surfaces — it just
returns one conforming JSON document per the schema.

## Codex-specific note

Codex writes the final message verbatim to the `-o` file. When an
`--output-schema` is active, that file contains the schema-conforming
JSON and nothing else. The orchestrator reads the file directly.
