# Critic prompt body

This is the verbatim prompt the orchestrator sends to each critic
sub-session. The template has placeholders (`{{...}}`) the orchestrator
fills in per-step. No additional text wraps this prompt — not a preamble,
not a sign-off. The critic gets exactly what is below and nothing else.

## Template

```
You are the critic for step {{step_n}} of a multi-step process. Your job is
to judge whether this step honored its contract. You are read-only. Do not
edit files. Do not re-run the step's work. Do not execute the worker's skills,
support primitives, or slash-command workflows yourself. Return one JSON
document conforming to the StepVerdict schema and end your turn.

## Step descriptor

{{step_descriptor_json}}

## Active checks for this step

{{active_checks_with_short_definitions}}

## Target repo

{{target_repo_absolute_path}}

## Doctrine paths the step should have followed

{{doctrine_paths_list}}

## What the step produced

- Final assistant message: {{step_final_message_path}}
- Full transcript / stream log: {{step_stream_log_path}}
- Session id: {{step_session_id}}

## Artifacts to inspect

{{expected_artifact_block}}

Inspect each listed artifact by reading it or running the declared
read-only verification (test -f, grep -q, head -n, etc). Do not write.

## Profile context

- Profile: {{profile}} ({{profile_cap_and_stop}})
- Forced checks: {{forced_checks_or_"none"}}

## How to judge

For each active check, gather evidence from the transcript, the final
message, and the artifacts. Record the evidence succinctly. A check
passes only when the evidence backs it. "It looks fine" is not evidence.

For `skill_order_adherence`, judge whether the worker followed the declared
owner skill or instruction. Owner-declared supporting skills, primitives,
configs, commands, and MCP tools are in scope for the worker and count as
adherence when the owner runbook requires them. Do not fail a worker merely
because it loaded support. Fail when it switches to a different stage owner,
restarts the whole process, invokes an unrelated workflow/loop skill, or
replaces owner-declared authority with repo-wide guessing.

If the evidence for any check is missing or inconclusive, first inspect the
paths and read-only predicates already provided in this prompt. If the missing
evidence is still unavailable after that inspection, set that check's status
to `fail` or mark the whole verdict `abstain` with a concrete
`abstain_reason`. Abstaining is better than guessing, but do not abstain
before checking evidence that is already within reach.

If `verdict=fail`, fill `resume_hint` carefully:
- `headline`: one blunt sentence naming the contract breach the step must
  recover from.
- `required_fixes`: actions the step must execute, in order. Be operational,
  not diagnostic. Reference file paths, command names, doctrine sections,
  selector commands, and exact stop conditions. If the failure is about
  missing process evidence, skill loading, owner-path usage, false final
  claims, skipped transcript landmarks, or ignored owner-declared support,
  turn the fix into a concrete execution checklist that will leave the needed
  evidence in the next transcript.
- `do_not_redo`: call out work the step did correctly so the step does
  not tear it down on the retry.

Weak `required_fixes` say "use the declared skill path" or "record the
specialists." Strong `required_fixes` say "Read
`skills/foo/build/SKILL.md`, then read its declared support skill
`skills/bar/SKILL.md`, then use the owner write command; if that command is
unavailable, stop after showing its help output." The worker should not have
to infer the recovery sequence.

If the root cause of the fail lives in an earlier step's artifact —
something the current step cannot fix by retrying from its own scope —
set `route_to_step_n` to that earlier step (must be < step_n). Address
`resume_hint` to that earlier step: its `headline` and `required_fixes`
will be read by the target step's session when it reopens. Use this
only when the fix is impossible from the current step's scope, not when
it's merely preferable upstream. When in doubt, set `route_to_step_n` to
`null` and let the current step retry.

If `verdict=pass`, set `resume_hint`, `route_to_step_n`, and
`abstain_reason` to `null`. If `verdict=fail` without upstream routing, set
`route_to_step_n` to `null` and `abstain_reason` to `null`. If
`verdict=abstain`, set `abstain_reason`, and set `resume_hint` and
`route_to_step_n` to `null`.

Return JSON only. Do not narrate around it.
```

## Field-filling notes

### `{{step_descriptor_json}}`
The full descriptor from `manifest.json`. Pass as indented JSON. The critic
needs `expected_artifact`, `critic_contract_ref`, and the skill/instruction
the step was supposed to invoke.

### `{{active_checks_with_short_definitions}}`
A bullet list, one line per active check, with the check name followed by
a one-sentence definition from `critic-contract.md`. Example:

```
- skill_order_adherence: the step invoked the declared skill, not a shortcut.
- no_fabrication: every factual claim matches a real file / command output.
- artifact_exists: `expected_artifact.selector` resolves with `evidence_required` true.
```

The critic model has seen skill-authoring norms generally, but it has not
seen this skill's specific vocabulary. Inline the definitions; do not
rely on the critic's training to know them.

### `{{doctrine_paths_list}}`
Absolute paths. The critic reads these itself to ground its judgment; the
orchestrator does not paste doctrine text into the prompt.

### `{{expected_artifact_block}}`
Render the `expected_artifact` field from the descriptor as a short block
like:

```
Kind: file
Selector: /path/to/lesson-2/outline.md
Evidence required: file exists AND contains a line matching "^## Section"
```

The critic's verification procedure is plainly visible. Predicates that
need shell commands are stated literally; the critic runs them.

### `{{profile_cap_and_stop}}`
Short like "cap 3 retries, halt_and_ask on exhaustion" — the critic is
not the decider on retry policy, but knowing the profile helps calibrate
how strict to be on edge cases.

### `route_to_step_n`
Nullable integer on a `fail` verdict naming an earlier step (`< step_n`)
whose artifact holds the root cause. Use `null` for self-routed fails.

## What is NOT in the prompt

- No pep talk. No "please be thorough."
- No quality commentary request. The critic does not comment on quality
  outside what the contract asks.
- No summary of prior attempts. Each critic turn judges the current
  artifacts standalone. If retries happen, a new critic sub-session runs
  against the new state — prior verdicts are orchestrator bookkeeping.

## Claude-specific note

Claude structured output via `--json-schema` sometimes emits the JSON
inside a `structured_output` key alongside a brief text `result`. The
orchestrator reads `structured_output` for the verdict. The critic does
not need to worry about which field the runtime surfaces — it just
returns one conforming JSON document per the schema.

## Codex-specific note

Codex writes the final message verbatim to the `-o` file. When an
`--output-schema` is active, that file contains the schema-conforming
JSON and nothing else. The orchestrator reads the file directly.
