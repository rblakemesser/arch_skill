# stepwise

Execute an ordered multi-step process in a target repo. Each independent step
runs in a new clean child using transport selected for that step. Same-host
work normally uses an active-host native child; the existing Claude, Codex, and
Grok subprocess harness is the explicit external adapter. A new clean critic
judges whether each attempt honored its declared contract. When a critic fails
or abstains with inspectable evidence, Stepwise diagnoses the failure before
repair: it reads the evidence, talks directly to the exact relevant child,
walks upstream when inputs are suspect, and authors the repair prompt itself.

Stepwise maintains a truthful chain from user intent to manifest, from manifest
to owner skill, from owner skill to worker action, from worker action to
evidence, and from evidence to critic judgment. When the chain breaks,
Stepwise locates the break and restores truth. It does not paper over the
break.

## When to use

- "ramp up on <topic> and implement <lesson> strictly according to <skill> order"
- "run <named process> in ../<repo> and make sure no steps are skipped"
- "orchestrate <multi-step flow> with a critic checking each step"
- "just get it done but don't make stuff up" where the request still needs
  ordered child roles and auditable evidence

## When not to use

- Free-form requirement loops with no step manifest -> native `/goal`.
- Plan-doc-backed implementation of a fixed architecture plan -> `$arch-step`.
- Bet-and-learn optimization, one bet per iteration with worklog ->
  `$goal-loop`.
- One-shot review of a diff or branch -> the host agent's normal review
  response. Use `$codex-review-yolo` only when the exact external `yolo`
  profile and its receipts are the requested benefit.
- Work that fits in a single orchestrator turn with no child roles.

## Non-negotiables

- Truthful propagation is the single invariant. Every pass corresponds to
  honest evidence. Every fail is diagnosed to root cause before repair. No step
  passes with fabricated evidence; no repair prompt contains invented
  constraints.
- Pin `raw_instructions` verbatim with `sha256`. Any rewrite clears run state.
- Produce a Step Manifest and confirm it with the user before any step
  executes. Strictness tunes the gate's behavior; it never removes it.
- Apply `../_shared/agent-orchestration-policy.md` at every dispatch.
  Prefer clean native children for ordinary same-host workers and critics. Use
  an external session when a concrete provider, exact model/profile, durable
  lifecycle, worktree/process isolation, automation surface, structured
  receipt, or another real benefit is worth the extra process and integration
  cost. These examples are recognition aids, not an allowlist.
- Every worker step starts as a new clean child. Diagnostic and repair messages
  resume that exact child so the worker keeps its own role history.
- Every critic is a new clean, independent child. The critic observes and
  returns structured JSON conforming to `StepVerdict`; it never prescribes
  future worker actions and is never resumed.
- The critic observes; the orchestrator reasons; the worker executes. The
  critic never writes agent commands. The orchestrator never edits target-repo
  files or invents constraints. The worker never sees orchestrator-internal
  vocabulary.
- Native starting context is explicit. Codex dispatch always sets
  `fork_turns` to `"none"` for normal workers and critics, to a positive count
  only for deliberately bounded chat context, or to `"all"` only when the full
  conversation is genuinely load-bearing. Claude uses a clean named subagent
  by default; an explicit conversation fork means full inherited conversation,
  while a skill with `context: fork` is an isolated clean subagent context.
  Context is separate from permissions, capabilities, and worktree isolation.
- The orchestrator owns fanout and integration. Worker and critic prompts
  forbid creating other model agents or invoking delegation/consult skills
  unless the orchestrator explicitly assigns a bounded nested scope and budget.
- Every critic fail and every inspectable abstain enters the same diagnostic
  protocol. Stepwise holds read-only diagnostic conversation with the agents
  involved, walking upstream when evidence points there, until root cause is
  located or the diagnostic turn cap is exhausted.
- If diagnosis shows a step received bad input from an earlier step, repair the
  upstream worker that owns the bad input. Downstream steps start new clean
  replacements after upstream repair; resuming downstream children would
  compound broken context.
- Every hard boundary and operational instruction in a repair prompt carries a
  source tag: user, manifest, owner runbook, critic evidence, or confirmed
  diagnosis. Unsourced boundaries or instructions are invented and must be
  removed.
- Learnings are consulted with applicability tests and surfaced in Stepwise's
  reasoning. They never appear as worker-facing doctrine. Workers act on owner
  doctrine, not on Stepwise process memory.
- Permissions and worktree behavior are resolved independently from context.
  Use enforced read-only capability for critics when the host exposes it,
  retain the no-edit prompt contract, and compare target-repo state before and
  after critic work. External worker and critic subprocesses keep the existing
  dangerous / skip-permissions / no-sandbox convention; that convention does
  not describe native children.
- Native same-host roles need no invented runtime/model promise. For an
  external lane, base runtime and effort are supplied by the user or target
  doctrine for worker and critic independently. Models are also supplied
  except that an external Codex lane with no named model defaults to
  `gpt-5.6-sol`. Ask once only for missing load-bearing external values.
- Optional execution preferences are interpreted after the Step Manifest is
  drafted. A phrase like "copywriting steps use Claude Fable 5" is a routing
  preference to resolve against real steps, not a built-in category.
- Orchestrator does not persistently load the target repo's contents into its
  own context. It points clean children at paths; children read source truth.
- Resolve profile, execution routing, and repair limits from the complete user
  prompt, then quote the source phrase in the announcement when a specific
  phrase drives the decision.
- Default broken-step repair limit is 5 operational repair bounces. A clear
  user bound such as "up to three times" can override it; otherwise keep 5.
  Strict/balanced/lenient never changes this number.
- Diagnostic read-only turns do not consume repair bounces. Operational repair
  prompts do.
- In the external lane, do not use stateless-only worker flags because workers
  must be resumable. External critics use the runtime's fresh/stateless command
  shape where supported.
- Silent worker repair past the resolved repair limit, silent skipping, and
  silent advance on fail are forbidden. Apply `stop_discipline` when repair
  capacity is exhausted.
- Fabricated step completion, claim without artifact or transcript evidence,
  fails the step regardless of profile.
- Do not use `/loop` or `ScheduleWakeup` to bridge child work. Native roles use
  host wait/status primitives. The external lane uses foreground
  `run_stepwise.py` calls; if a subprocess genuinely outlasts the shell
  timeout, use supported background execution and its harness receipt.
- Long children commonly take 5+ minutes. For native roles, use host child
  state; for external `xhigh` or `max` turns, inspect live `stream.log` and
  process liveness every few minutes rather than polling every few seconds or
  treating a missing final file as a hang before exit.

## First move

1. Capture the user's prompt verbatim. Compute `sha256`.
2. Read `../_shared/agent-orchestration-policy.md`.
3. Read `references/strictness-profiles.md`. Interpret profile, forced
   checks, stop discipline, and broken-step repair limit.
4. Read `references/model-and-effort.md` and
   `references/execution-routing.md`. Resolve transport, clean starting
   context, and any external execution preferences. Ask one consolidated
   question only when a selected external lane lacks load-bearing values.
5. Resolve `target_repo_path` as an absolute path. Fail loud if unresolvable.
6. Read `references/workflow-contract.md` for the five-phase workflow.
7. Read `references/diagnose-and-repair.md` before executing any child
   loop.
8. Read `references/unblocking.md` before deciding a child failure is a
   user-facing blocker.
9. Announce the interpretation before Phase 2.

## Workflow

Five phases. Detail lives in `references/workflow-contract.md`.

1. **Intake & interpretation.** Parse the prompt; set profile, forced checks,
   stop discipline, repair limit, execution defaults, and unresolved execution
   preferences. Announce.
2. **Process grounding.** Read the target repo's `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`
   and the named process's `SKILL.md`. Draft steps, resolve execution
   preferences against those steps, and write `manifest.json` per
   `references/manifest-schema.md`.
3. **Plan confirmation.** Print manifest + interpretation. Gate per profile:
   strict always pauses, balanced pauses once, lenient prints and proceeds.
   Always include the resolved dispatch table.
4. **Step execution loop.** For each step: start a clean worker, start a clean
   observational critic, advance on pass, and on fail or inspectable abstain
   run the single diagnose-and-repair protocol. Repair at the root-cause
   worker, start downstream replacements clean after upstream repair, and halt
   when repair capacity or diagnostic clarity is exhausted.
5. **Report.** Per-step status table, run directory path, instructive critic
   observations, diagnostic records, learnings considered/written, and pending
   work if halted. No certification language.

## Output expectations

## The orchestration script

`scripts/run_stepwise.py` is deterministic run-state plumbing plus the explicit
external-session adapter. Its transport-neutral subcommands create and inspect
run artifacts; its launch subcommands spawn external processes, capture session
ids, and validate critic verdicts. It does not choose transport, interpret the
user's prompt, draft the manifest, decide root cause, or author repairs.

Subcommands:

- `init-run` - create the run directory and initial `state.json`.
- `step-spawn` - spawn a new clean external worker session; capture session id.
- `step-resume` - resume an existing worker session with an operational repair
  prompt.
- `step-diagnose` - resume an existing worker session read-only and write the
  diagnostic turn into `diagnostic/` without consuming a repair bounce.
- `critic-spawn` - spawn a new clean external critic with a structured schema;
  parse and validate the observational verdict.
- `latest-session` - print latest try/session metadata for a step.
- `upstream-for` - print manifest-declared upstream artifacts and latest
  sessions for a step.
- `report-scaffold` - print or write a deterministic `report.md` scaffold.

Run `python3 scripts/run_stepwise.py <subcommand> --help` for flags.
