# arch-epic

Wraps `$arch-step` to orchestrate goals too big for one canonical plan.
The skill takes a prose goal, proposes a plain-English decomposition
whose count follows proof gates rather than a preset range, gets user approval, and then drives
each sub-plan through arch-step's `new` → `auto-plan` → `implement-loop`
→ `audit-implementation` arc. After each sub-plan completes, a fresh
Claude, Codex, or Grok critic subprocess inspects the shipped work for scope
drift against the approved North Star. If the critic finds a requirement
needed to preserve approved scope or a non-trivial scope change, the skill
halts and asks the user how to preserve the scope by extending the current
sub-plan or inserting a new sub-plan.
Otherwise it advances to the next sub-plan.

The normal lane is interactive and re-entrant: arch-epic invokes or observes
arch-step commands in the visible session one transition at a time.

The same-session automatic commands are explicit and opt-in:
`auto-plan` plans every approved sub-plan to the `arch-step auto-plan`
readiness bar before implementation starts, and `auto-implement` implements
the planned sub-plans in order through the `arch-step auto-implement` /
`implement-loop` contract.

The spawned harness lane is also explicit and opt-in. After the user approves the
decomposition, arch-epic asks for a role-based execution table:
`epic_planner`, `implementation_worker`, and `critic`.
It resolves shorthand such as `opus 4.7 xhigh` or `gpt 5.5 high` to
runnable model IDs using the shared resolver doctrine, pins the resolved
policy, then drives sub-plans depth-first with spawned child harnesses whose
hooks are disabled for subprocess isolation. Spawned workers apply arch-step
doctrine directly from disk; they do not invoke nested `auto-plan`,
`implement-loop`, or other automatic continuation commands.

Spawned planner and implementation worker sessions are resumable. If a
fresh critic finds in-scope unfinished work, arch-epic resumes the same
planner or implementation session with the critic's observation and artifact
evidence. The critic never prescribes repair steps, and ordinary repair does
not start a separate repair-worker session.

Progressive lazy planning is the default for interactive and spawned-harness
work: sub-plan N+1 is not planned until sub-plan N is complete. Same-session
`auto-plan` is the deliberate exception: it plans all approved sub-plans first,
then stops before implementation. The user approves the decomposition up front, then
approves each sub-plan's North Star when it comes up in interactive
mode. In spawned-harness mode, spawned critics check North Star and Epic
Requirement Coverage gates instead of asking the user on every sub-plan.

Resume is the only mode — every `$arch-epic` invocation re-reads the
epic doc and sub-plan docs from disk and picks up where things left
off. "Continue my epic", "pick up where we left off", "keep going on
<project>" all work.

The skill is a thoughtful wrapper — its job is to reduce user
orchestration burden. In interactive mode, user involvement is bounded
to the goal, decomposition, per-sub-plan North Star, and material
scope-preservation decisions. In spawned-harness mode, the user approves the
decomposition and role table up front; spawned critics replace
per-sub-plan North-Star pauses unless a material ambiguity or scope
change requires the user.

## When to use

- "This is too big for one arch-step plan. Help me break it into plans
  and run them in order."
- "Orchestrate these sub-plans: X, Y, Z. Check each one before moving
  to the next."
- "Continue my epic at `docs/EPIC_<slug>_<date>.md`."
- "Keep going on the <goal> epic."
- "Pick up where we left off on <project>."
- "Automatically implement this approved epic end to end."
- "Auto-plan every sub-plan before we implement any of them."
- "Run `arch-epic auto-implement` on this approved epic."
- "Run the epic automatically and ask me which models to use for the
  planner, implementation worker, and critics."

## When not to use

- Single architecture plan, including single-plan automatic planning through
  implementation: use `$arch-step full-auto` or `$miniarch-step full-auto`.
- One-pass mini plan that hands off to implement: use `$arch-mini-plan`.
- 1–3 phase feature flow: use `$lilarch`.
- Open-ended optimization with bet-and-learn iteration: use `$goal-loop`.
- Read-only routing across arch artifacts: use `$arch-flow`.
- Stepped orchestration in a foreign repo with a per-step critic: use
  `$stepwise`.
- One-shot review of a diff, branch, or completion claim: use
  ordinary host review or `$codex-review-yolo`.
- Work that fits in a single orchestrator turn.

## Non-negotiables

Must happen every run:
- Pin `raw_goal` verbatim with `sha256` in the epic doc. Any silent
  rewrite clears the decomposition-approved flag.
- Produce a one-sentence-per-sub-plan decomposition and get user
  approval before planning any sub-plan.
- Each sub-plan is its own full `$arch-step` canonical DOC_PATH.
  The epic doc does NOT contain plan internals (no Sections 0–10,
  no call-site audit).
- Progressive planning: in interactive and spawned-harness modes, invoke
  `$arch-step new` or planner harness work for sub-plan N+1 only after sub-plan
  N is `complete` per the epic critic. In same-session `auto-plan`, create or
  repair each sub-plan DOC_PATH in order by applying the `arch-step` `new`
  artifact contract directly, and stop before implementation.
- Per-sub-plan North Star approval uses `$arch-step`'s existing
  North-Star gate. `arch-epic` does not re-invent it — it just
  stops when arch-step stops. In spawned-harness mode, this gate is replaced
  by a fresh North-Star critic harness after the user-approved
  decomposition and role table are pinned. In same-session `auto-plan`, the
  approved decomposition can stand in for per-sub-plan user approval only when
  the sub-plan North Star is a direct, unambiguous expansion of the approved
  epic scope; otherwise stop and ask.
- Per-sub-plan implementation runs through
  `$arch-step implement-loop` in interactive mode and `$arch-step
  auto-implement` in same-session `auto-implement`. In spawned-harness mode,
  spawned implementation workers execute the approved sub-plan directly
  from arch-step doctrine and the sub-plan doc; the top-level
  orchestrator still does not edit target code itself.
- Epic critic runs once per sub-plan at sub-plan completion and
  returns structured JSON `EpicVerdict`. Critic is a separate
  subprocess (`claude`, `codex`, or `grok`).
- Both arch-step invocations and critic subprocesses run dangerous
  / skip-permissions / no-sandbox per repo convention.
- User supplies execution policy at invocation or at the role-table
  gate. Interactive mode needs critic runtime + model + effort.
  Spawned-harness mode needs role execution for `epic_planner`,
  `implementation_worker`, and `critic`. The skill asks once for
  missing role values and never silently defaults. Existing policies
  with legacy `repair_worker` values may load, but ordinary critic
  failures resume the original planner or implementation worker session.
  Same-session `auto-plan` needs no role table. Same-session
  `auto-implement` uses the same critic runtime/model/effort policy as the
  interactive completion critic.
- Resume is re-entrant: any invocation against an existing epic doc
  re-reads on-disk state and continues. No dedicated `resume`
  command.

Must never happen:
- `arch-epic` editing the target repo's code directly. Sub-plans do
  that via arch-step's implement-loop in interactive mode or spawned
  implementation workers in spawned-harness mode.
- Scope reduction. The epic scope is the epic scope. If the critic
  sees a dropped, narrowed, or silently removed requirement from the raw
  goal, approved Decomposition, North Star, Epic Requirement Coverage,
  Section 7, acceptance criteria, or verification obligations, the
  sub-plan fails. A requirement assigned to a named later sub-plan is
  preserved scope, not a failure for the current sub-plan. Agent-written
  Decision Log entries are evidence, not approval to reduce scope.
- Auto-acting on materially-different-path detections without user
  approval. Material scope discoveries always halt and preserve scope
  through `extend_current` or `new_sub_plan`. There is no automatic
  drop path and no supported scope-reduction lane inside any arch-epic
  automation lane.
- Letting critics author repair steps. Critics report verdict,
  failed checks, evidence, and scope discoveries only. The parent
  routes the result, and the resumed planner or implementation worker
  owns the reasoning for the next attempt.
- Spawning a separate repair worker for ordinary in-scope critic
  failures. Same-role resume is the default repair path; a new role
  session is only for unrecoverable session loss or explicit user
  override.
- Parallel planning or parallel implementation. Same-session `auto-plan` may
  plan every sub-plan before implementation, but it still handles one sub-plan
  at a time in decomposition order. Implementation always runs one sub-plan at
  a time and advances only after the epic critic passes.
- Same-session `auto-implement` starting while any non-complete sub-plan is not
  `planned`. Plan all sub-plans first with `auto-plan`.
- Two-second child polling. Spawned-harness mode defaults to 180-second waits
  while waiting for spawned harnesses unless the user explicitly pins a
  different cadence in the role policy.
- Calling a slow planner or worker "hung" just because it has no final
  artifact after a few minutes. Spawned children often run for 5+ minutes;
  broad `xhigh` or `max` planner/worker runs can reasonably take 20-40
  minutes. Use process state plus `events.jsonl`, `stderr.log`,
  `stream.log`, `heartbeat.json`, and `monitor.json`; treat recent
  thinking/tool/output stream activity as progress.
- Terminating a child before the long-run floors expire unless there is
  clear failure evidence. Default expectations are: poll every 180s,
  call a run `quiet` only after 900s without stream activity, and call
  it `needs_attention` only after 1800s without stream activity or after
  the pinned max runtime.
- Passing raw model shorthand to subprocesses. Resolve it first using
  shared model-resolution doctrine; preserve exact family/version or
  ask for the runnable ID.
- Heuristic keyword mapping for decomposition. Interpretation is
  prose reasoning, taught by `references/decomposition-principles.md`.
- A second "resume" command. The user types what they type; the
  skill figures it out from the epic doc + sub-plan docs.

## First move

1. Capture the user's goal verbatim. Compute `sha256`.
2. Resolve or propose the epic doc path
   (`docs/EPIC_<TITLE>_<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`).
3. Read `references/model-and-effort.md`. If the user is starting
   the interactive lane and did not name runtime + model + effort for
   the critic, ask one consolidated question. If the user explicitly
   asked for same-session `auto-plan`, defer critic choices because no critic
   runs during planning. If the user explicitly asked for same-session
   `auto-implement`, ask for missing critic choices before the first epic
   critic runs. If the user explicitly asked for role-based spawned-harness
   execution, defer execution choices to the role-table gate after
   decomposition approval.
4. Read `references/decomposition-principles.md`. Draft the
   Decomposition (one-sentence descriptions, assertion-style gates,
   dependency-then-risk ordering, and count chosen from real proof
   boundaries rather than a target range).
5. Read `references/epic-doc-contract.md`. Write the epic doc.
6. Surface the Decomposition and ask the user to approve or adjust.

## Modes (re-entrant; one per turn)

Detail per mode lives in `references/workflow-contract.md`.

1. **`start`** — epic doc does not yet exist. Propose path, ask for
   critic model/effort if missing, draft Decomposition, surface for
   approval.
2. **`approve-decomposition`** — epic doc has
   `sub_plans_approved: false`. Apply user adjustments, flip flag,
   set `status: active`.
3. **`run`** — main orchestration pass. Routes per
   `references/arch-step-integration.md` to the next arch-step
   command for the first non-complete sub-plan or runs the critic.
4. **`resume-scope-change`** — epic is `halted` after a critic
   flagged a scope change; user has replied with their preservation
   decision. Apply `extend_current` or `new_sub_plan`, log, resume.
5. **`summary`** — user asked a status question. Render a table of
   sub-plan statuses and the most recent log entries. No state
   changes.
6. **`auto-plan`** — same-session planning driver after decomposition
   approval. Creates or repairs every sub-plan DOC_PATH, runs each one through
   `$arch-step auto-plan`, marks each ready sub-plan `planned`, and stops before
   implementation.
7. **`auto-implement`** — same-session implementation driver. Requires every
   non-complete sub-plan to be `planned`, then runs each in order through
   `$arch-step auto-implement` plus the epic critic.
8. **`auto-run`** — explicit spawned-harness lane after decomposition
   approval. Resolve/pin the role execution table, initialize the
   auto run directory, then drive one active sub-plan depth-first
   through resumable planner and implementation worker sessions plus
   fresh critic harnesses.

## Output expectations

- Epic doc at the user-named (or proposed) path.
- Per-sub-plan canonical arch-step DOC_PATHs under
  `docs/epic/<EPIC_SLUG_WITH_DATE>/PHASE_<NN>_<SUBPLAN_SLUG>_<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`,
  owned by arch-step.
- Same-session `auto-plan` leaves non-complete sub-plans at Status `planned`
  when their `arch-step` receipt gate is ready.
- Epic critic artifacts under
  `<orchestrator repo root>/.arch_skill/arch-epic/critics/<slug>/run-<ts>/`
  including the EpicVerdict JSON, the exact invocation.sh, and the
  subprocess stream log.
- Spawned-harness automatic artifacts under
  `<orchestrator repo root>/.arch_skill/arch-epic/auto/<epic-slug>/run-<ts>/`
  including `state.json`, `execution_policy.json`, worker prompts,
  worker session IDs, latest worker-attempt pointers, critic verdicts, child `events.jsonl`,
  `stderr.log`, `stream.log`, `heartbeat.json`, `monitor.json`, and
  `report.md`.
- Orchestration Log and Decision Log append-only in the epic doc.
- Console summary with the epic doc path, the per-sub-plan status
  table, and the current active sub-plan's next action.

## The orchestration script

`scripts/run_arch_epic.py` is deterministic plumbing. It resolves
spawned-harness execution policy, creates run directories, spawns and
resumes workers, spawns structured critics, and writes artifacts. It
does NOT interpret decomposition, draft the epic doc, decide verdicts,
or route sub-plan states — those live in the orchestrator's prose
reasoning.
