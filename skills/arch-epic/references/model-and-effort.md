# Role execution policy: user-supplied, asked once

`arch-epic` uses external Claude/Codex subprocesses in two places:

- interactive mode: the epic critic at sub-plan completion
- automatic mode: planner, implementation worker, repair worker, and critics

The user supplies runtime/model/effort for every required role, or the skill
asks once before running. Different roles deserve different price points, so
automatic mode must not collapse the whole epic into one hidden default.

## Interactive mode

Interactive mode needs one critic execution block:

- `critic_runtime`: `claude` or `codex`
- `critic_model`: runnable CLI model identifier
- `critic_effort`: `low | medium | high | xhigh | max`

These values live in the epic doc frontmatter for compatibility with existing
epic docs. They may remain null when the user explicitly chose automatic mode
and the role execution table has not been pinned yet; automatic critics use
the `auto_execution.roles.critic` block.

## Automatic mode

Automatic mode asks for a role table after decomposition approval:

| Role | What it controls |
| --- | --- |
| `epic_planner` | sub-plan DOC_PATH creation, North Star drafting, Epic Requirement Coverage, planning repairs |
| `implementation_worker` | implementation, verification, worklog updates, ordinary in-scope code/docs edits |
| `repair_worker` | operational repair after critic findings; may be `same as implementation_worker` when the user chooses that |
| `critic` | North Star critic, plan-readiness critic, implementation/scope critic, final epic critic |

Example table:

```text
epic_planner: claude opus 4.7 xhigh
implementation_worker: codex gpt 5.4 xhigh
repair_worker: same as implementation_worker
critic: codex gpt 5.4 mini xhigh
poll_seconds: 60
```

The resolved policy is stored under `auto_execution` in the epic doc and in
the automatic run directory's `state.json`.

## Shared resolver owner

The deterministic helper is `skills/_shared/model_resolution.py`. It encodes
the same doctrine used by Stepwise and fresh-consult:

- preserve model family and numeric version exactly
- infer runtime only from unambiguous family evidence
- inspect `codex debug models` when Codex model availability matters
- prefer `claude-<family>-<version-with-hyphens>` for Claude family+version
  phrases
- ask for the runnable ID when discovery is unavailable, ambiguous, or missing
- never run paid trial prompts to discover whether a Claude model exists

Do not add another local model-name lookup table in arch-epic. If the rule
needs to change, update the shared helper and the shared doctrine references.

## Acceptable user phrasing

All of these are valid when they include a role:

- "planner on Claude Opus 4.7 xhigh"
- "implementation worker on Codex gpt-5.4 xhigh"
- "repair same as implementation"
- "critics on gpt 5.4 mini xhigh"
- "codex gpt-5.4 high everywhere"

If the user gives one complete "everywhere" value, the orchestrator may fill
all four roles with that value, but it must announce the interpretation before
running.

## Model phrase resolution

Treat model text as intent, not a loose alias:

- `gpt 5.5` may normalize to `gpt-5.5`; it must not become `gpt-5.4`.
- `gpt 5.4 mini` may normalize to `gpt-5.4-mini`.
- `opus 4.7` under Claude may normalize to `claude-opus-4-7`; it must not
  become another Opus version.
- Family-only Claude aliases such as `opus`, `sonnet`, or `haiku` are allowed
  only when the user did not pin a version.
- If the phrase names both Claude and Codex families, ask the user to split
  the role choices.

Always print the raw-to-resolved mapping before execution:

```text
critic: "codex gpt 5.4 mini xhigh" -> runtime=codex, model=gpt-5.4-mini, effort=xhigh
planner: "Claude Opus 4.7 high" -> runtime=claude, model=claude-opus-4-7, effort=high
```

## Asking when missing

Ask one consolidated question that names the missing roles and what they
control. Do not ask one question per field.

Use this shape:

```text
Before I run the epic automatically, I need the role execution table. These
choices control real spawned subprocesses and model budget.

- epic_planner: drafts/repairs sub-plan North Stars and requirement coverage
- implementation_worker: edits code/docs and runs verification
- repair_worker: fixes critic findings
- critic: checks North Star, plan readiness, completion, and scope drift

Please give runtime/model/effort for each role, or say which roles should be
"same as" another role.
```

If one role is complete and another is missing, preserve the complete role and
ask only for the missing ones.

## Pinning

Automatic mode writes:

- `source_quotes`: the raw user role text
- `roles`: resolved runtime/model/effort blocks
- `poll_seconds`: default `60` unless explicitly overridden
- `execution_sha256`: stable hash of the resolved policy

Changing any role mid-run creates a new policy hash. The orchestrator must log
the change in the epic Decision Log and apply it only to future child runs.
Past worker and critic artifacts keep the invocation they actually used.
