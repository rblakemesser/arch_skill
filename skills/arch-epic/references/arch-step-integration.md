# arch-step integration

The skill invokes `$arch-step` commands as slash commands in the
orchestrator's own session. It does NOT shell out to `claude -p` or
`codex exec` for interactive arch-step work. arch-step runs in the
same session as `arch-epic`, so native goal-mode continuation can see
the same plan truth.

That rule applies to interactive mode and to the same-session
`arch-epic auto-plan` / `arch-epic auto-implement` drivers. Spawned-harness
automatic mode is a separate explicit lane: spawned workers do not invoke `$arch-step auto-plan`,
`implement-loop`, or any other automatic continuation command. Instead,
the worker prompt points at arch-step's reference files and tells the
child to apply the doctrine directly against the sub-plan DOC_PATH. This
avoids nested continuation while still preserving arch-step's artifact and
quality contract.

This reference maps sub-plan Status to the exact arch-step command
the skill issues next. It is the operational cheat sheet the
orchestrator prose leans on.

Same-session `arch-epic auto-plan` and `arch-epic auto-implement` share the
same status vocabulary but use a different stopping point: `auto-plan` stops at
Status `planned` for every sub-plan, and `auto-implement` is the only
same-session command that moves planned sub-plans into implementation.

## Mapping

### Status `pending`

Meaning: this sub-plan has a name and a one-sentence description in
the Decomposition, but no arch-step doc yet.

Next action:
1. If the sub-plan's DOC_PATH is empty in the Decomposition, propose
   an arch-epic grouped path:
   `docs/epic/<EPIC_SLUG_WITH_DATE>/PHASE_<NN>_<SUBPLAN_SLUG>_<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`.
   Derive `<EPIC_SLUG_WITH_DATE>` from the epic doc stem without the
   leading `EPIC_`; derive `<NN>` from the Decomposition order at the
   moment the DOC_PATH is assigned; derive `<SUBPLAN_SLUG>` from the
   sub-plan's name. Ask the user to accept or override. Silence means
   proceed with the proposed path. Preserve any already-created
   DOC_PATHs; if a later scope-change decision inserts a new sub-plan
   between existing numbered docs, use a sortable fractional slot such
   as `PHASE_01_5_<SUBPLAN_SLUG>_<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` instead of renaming
   existing docs or worklogs.
2. Fill the DOC_PATH field in the Decomposition entry.
3. Invoke `$arch-step new <DOC_PATH>` with the sub-plan's
   one-sentence description as the North Star seed (pass it through
   as the initial intent prose to arch-step).
4. Append to Orchestration Log: `Sub-plan N invoked: $arch-step new <DOC_PATH>`.
5. End the turn. arch-step's `new` command pauses for the user to
   confirm the North Star inside Section 0 of the new doc.

Do not update the sub-plan Status yet. The user's next turn will
either confirm the North Star (arch-step flow) or ask for
adjustments. On the turn after that, the skill reads the arch-step
doc's frontmatter.

Same-session `auto-plan` exception: when the user explicitly asked for
`arch-epic auto-plan`, do not invoke `$arch-step new` and stop for a separate
North Star approval turn. Instead, assign the grouped DOC_PATH and apply the
`arch-step new` artifact contract directly from the approved Decomposition,
raw epic goal, prior gates, and Epic Requirement Coverage. This is allowed only
when the resulting sub-plan North Star is a direct, unambiguous expansion of
approved epic scope; otherwise stop and ask.

### Status transition: `pending` → `north-star-approved`

Detected by reading the sub-plan's arch-step DOC_PATH frontmatter:
`status: active` means the user confirmed the North Star. Update
the epic doc's sub-plan Status to `north-star-approved` and append
to log: `Sub-plan N North Star approved by user.`

### Status `north-star-approved`

Next action:
1. Invoke `$arch-step auto-plan <DOC_PATH>`.
2. Update Status to `planning`.
3. Append to log: `Sub-plan N auto-plan started.`
4. In native goal mode, let `$arch-step auto-plan` continue through
   research, two deep-dive passes, phase-plan, and consistency-pass.
   Outside goal mode, stop after the bounded pass and resume this mapping
   on the next user turn.

### Status `planning`

Read the sub-plan's DOC_PATH and look for `arch_skill:block:consistency_pass`
with `Decision-complete: yes` and `Decision: proceed to implement? yes`.
If present, planning is done.

- In interactive `run` mode, update Status to `implementing`, invoke
  `$arch-step implement-loop <DOC_PATH>`, and append to log:
  `Sub-plan N auto-plan completed. Sub-plan N implement-loop started.`
- In same-session `arch-epic auto-plan`, run
  `python3 skills/arch-step/scripts/arch_stage_gate.py ready --doc <DOC_PATH>`.
  If it exits 0, update Status to `planned`, append to log:
  `Sub-plan N auto-plan completed. Status set to planned.`, then move to the
  next sub-plan in native goal mode or stop with the next exact command outside
  goal mode.

If the consistency-pass block is absent or not ready, invoke
`$arch-step auto-plan <DOC_PATH>` again in goal mode, or report the exact
next bounded command outside goal mode. Do not silently advance.

### Status `planned`

Meaning: this sub-plan passed the `arch-step auto-plan` readiness bar and has
not started implementation.

Next action:
1. For ordinary interactive `run`, do not skip into implementation unless the
   user asked to run or continue implementation. Surface that the next exact
   command is `$arch-epic auto-implement <EPIC_DOC_PATH>` or
   `$arch-step implement-loop <DOC_PATH>` for this sub-plan.
2. For same-session `arch-epic auto-implement`, run
   `python3 skills/arch-step/scripts/arch_stage_gate.py ready --doc <DOC_PATH>`.
   If it exits 0, invoke `$arch-step auto-implement <DOC_PATH>`, update Status
   to `implementing`, and append to log:
   `Sub-plan N auto-implement started.`
3. If the gate is not ready, keep or reset the Status to `planning` and route
   back to `$arch-epic auto-plan <EPIC_DOC_PATH>`.

### Status `implementing`

Read the sub-plan's DOC_PATH and look for
`arch_skill:block:implementation_audit` with `Verdict (code): COMPLETE`.

If COMPLETE: run the epic critic (see `critic-contract.md` and
`critic-prompt.md`). The critic spawns as a subprocess via
`scripts/run_arch_epic.py critic-spawn`. Wait for the verdict.
Apply per the `Critic verdict` rules below.

If the audit block is present but says something other than COMPLETE
(NOT COMPLETE, reopened phases): do NOT run the epic critic. This is
an arch-step-level completion issue. Surface to the user with the
audit's reported blockers. The user decides whether to rerun
implement-loop, continue in goal mode, or intervene.

If the audit block is absent entirely: implement-loop ended without
writing the audit. Run or request `$arch-step implement-loop <DOC_PATH>` or
`$arch-step auto-implement <DOC_PATH>` depending on the current command; do not
silently advance.

### Critic verdict: `pass`

- Update sub-plan Status to `complete`.
- Write the verdict path into the Epic-critic verdict field for
  that sub-plan.
- Append to log: `Epic critic run on sub-plan N: verdict=pass.`
- Append to log: `Sub-plan N marked complete.`
- Loop back through the mapping from step 1 (first sub-plan with
  Status not `complete`). If all sub-plans are `complete`, flip
  `status: complete` on the epic doc and write the final summary.

### Critic verdict: `scope_change_detected`

- Halt. There is no auto-defer, auto-drop, or scope-reduction branch.
- Set epic `status: halted`, update sub-plan Status to
  `scope-changed`, write the verdict path, append a Decision Log entry
  that names the discovered items and the scope-preserving options, end
  the turn with the user question.

### Critic verdict: `incomplete`

Rare — arch-step's audit normally catches incomplete work before
the critic runs. When it happens: halt. Set `status: halted`,
update sub-plan Status back to `implementing`, append log, ask the
user whether to rerun implement-loop or investigate manually.

## What arch-epic does NOT invoke

- `$arch-step reformat` — the skill always uses `new` for fresh
  sub-plans. If the user wants to reformat an existing non-canonical
  doc as a sub-plan, they call reformat themselves outside
  arch-epic, then point the sub-plan's DOC_PATH at the reformatted
  doc and set Status to `pending` manually.
- `$arch-step research`, `deep-dive`, `external-research`,
  `phase-plan`, `consistency-pass`, `review-gate` as individual
  commands — those are handled by `auto-plan`. The skill
  does not sequence them manually.
- Helper commands: `plan-enhance`, `fold-in`, `overbuild-protector`.
  Users invoke those ad hoc per sub-plan if they want the extra
  passes. The skill does not run them.
- `$arch-step advance` — the skill routes from Status, not from
  arch-step's advance router. Two routers would disagree and the
  user would not know which won.
- `$arch-step full-auto` — single-plan full-auto belongs to `arch-step`
  itself. `arch-epic` already owns the multi-plan routing layer, so it
  invokes or observes the underlying `new`, `auto-plan`, and
  `implement-loop` / `auto-implement` transitions directly in interactive or
  same-session auto modes.
- `$arch-step status` as part of the loop — only if the user
  explicitly asks "what does arch-step think of sub-plan N?", in
  which case the skill relays the answer without acting on it.

## Spawned-harness automatic integration

Spawned-harness automatic mode uses the same sub-plan Status vocabulary, but the
transition owner changes:

- `pending`: planner harness creates or repairs the numbered per-epic
  DOC_PATH and Epic Requirement Coverage, then a critic checks the
  North Star gate.
- `north-star-approved`: planner/implementation harness performs the
  planning stages from arch-step doctrine directly. It does not arm
  `auto-plan`.
- `planning`: critic checks plan readiness and decision completeness.
- `planned`: normally produced by same-session `auto-plan`; spawned-harness
  mode may skip it because that lane checks planning gates with critics before
  implementation.
- `implementing`: implementation worker executes Section 7, updates the
  worklog, and leaves verification evidence. It does not arm
  `implement-loop`.
- completion: critic checks implementation audit, scope drift, and epic
  requirement coverage.

Spawned-harness automatic mode still treats the sub-plan DOC_PATH and worklog as the
truth. Child transcripts are evidence, not a second plan. The top-level
orchestrator records only compact artifact pointers in the epic doc.

If a critic finds in-scope unfinished work, the transition owner does not
change to a separate repair worker. The orchestrator resumes the same planner
session for planning-gate failures or the same implementation worker session
for implementation/completion failures, passing the critic verdict as
observation-only evidence. Critics do not prescribe repair steps.

## Cross-runtime parity

Everything above works identically on Claude Code and Codex because
`$arch-step`'s `auto-plan`, `implement-loop`, and `auto-implement` commands are native
goal-mode friendly in both runtimes. The epic skill checks sub-plan doc
truth rather than external automation state.

## When in doubt, surface

The decision tree above covers the common paths. Anything unusual
(doc contents contradict, missing audit block, status says planning while
the plan is already ready, etc.)
surfaces to the user. The skill does not hide exceptions. If you
find yourself tempted to paper over a weird state with an assumption,
don't — print what you see, name your best hypothesis, and ask.
