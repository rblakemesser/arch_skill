# Epic doc contract

The epic doc is the single on-disk artifact the skill reads and writes.
It is NOT an arch-step plan doc — it does not have Sections 0–10, no
call-site audit, no Section 7 checklist. It is an orchestration
document: an index of sub-plan DOC_PATHs, inter-plan gates, and an
append-only log of decisions and status changes.

Each sub-plan has its own full canonical arch-step DOC_PATH. The epic
doc points at those paths; it does not duplicate their contents.

## Location and naming

Default path: `docs/EPIC_<TITLE_SCREAMING_SNAKE>_<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`.
Example: `docs/EPIC_ADMIN_DASHBOARD_SSO_2026-04-22.md`.

The skill proposes this at `start` mode. If the user names a different
path in their invocation, use theirs verbatim. Silence means proceed
with the proposed path.

The epic doc lives in the orchestrator repo's `docs/` directory by
convention, alongside arch-step plan docs. Nothing in the shape is
repo-specific; it is just where the user expects architectural docs.

## Frontmatter

```yaml
---
title: Epic — <user's goal in plain English>
date: 2026-04-22
doc_type: epic
status: draft | active | complete | halted
raw_goal: |
  <verbatim user input that created this epic — every word, no edits>
raw_goal_sha256: <hex digest of the raw_goal string>
sub_plans_approved: false
critic_runtime: claude | codex
critic_model: <resolved CLI model, e.g. claude-opus-4-7>
critic_effort: <low | medium | high | xhigh | max>
models_sha256: <hex digest of {runtime, model, effort} tuple>
---
```

Frontmatter rules:

- `raw_goal` is the literal user invocation. Every word. If you
  normalize whitespace or rewrite, the hash breaks and the skill
  treats the doc as mutated.
- `raw_goal_sha256` is computed over `raw_goal` exactly. Recomputed
  on every `arch-epic` invocation. Mismatch means the user edited
  the goal mid-stream — the skill prints a loud error and asks
  whether to start a new epic or accept the change (clearing the
  decomposition-approved flag).
- `doc_type: epic` is the discriminator that distinguishes this
  artifact from an arch-step plan doc. Other tools may key on this.
- `status` transitions: `draft` → `active` (after decomposition
  approval) → (optionally) `halted` (on scope-change yield) →
  `active` (on user decision) → `complete` (all sub-plans pass).
- `sub_plans_approved` starts `false`. Flips to `true` exactly once:
  when the user approves the decomposition. If the user adjusts the
  decomposition after approval, the skill appends to the log and
  keeps `sub_plans_approved: true`; "approved" means "the user has
  seen and blessed the shape," not "the decomposition is frozen."
- `critic_runtime`, `critic_model`, `critic_effort` are user-supplied
  per `model-and-effort.md`. Not defaulted. `critic_model` stores the
  resolved runnable identifier, not raw shorthand.
- `models_sha256` is computed over the runtime/model/effort tuple.
  Changing any of them re-hashes. Past verdicts keep their old
  models recorded in their own artifacts.

## Body sections

### TL;DR

One paragraph in plain English. The goal, why this decomposition,
what order, what happens if something surprises us. Write for a
reader who has never seen the goal before.

Example:

> Ship a new admin dashboard protected by SSO. Decomposed into three
> sub-plans: SSO support in the auth service, the dashboard itself,
> and user migration. Built in that order because the dashboard can
> only be tested against a live SSO endpoint, and migration is only
> safe once the dashboard works. If implementation reveals a new
> system we did not anticipate (e.g., audit logging), the skill will
> halt and ask whether to extend the current sub-plan, insert a new
> one, or defer.

### Decomposition

A numbered list of sub-plans. Each entry has:

- The sub-plan name in bold and a one-sentence description in plain
  English.
- `DOC_PATH:` the path to the sub-plan's canonical arch-step doc.
  Empty at decomposition time for sub-plans that have not been
  started yet (lazy planning). Filled in when the skill invokes
  `$arch-step new` for that sub-plan.
- `Gate to next:` the assertion that must be true before the next
  sub-plan starts planning. The last sub-plan has no `Gate to next`.
- `Status:` one of `pending | north-star-approved | planning |
  implementing | complete | scope-changed`.
- `Epic-critic verdict:` empty until the sub-plan reaches
  completion; then the verdict path (relative or absolute) for
  audit.

Example:

```markdown
# Decomposition

1. **Ship SSO in the auth service**: Add SAML/OIDC support to the
   existing email-password auth service.
   - DOC_PATH: docs/AUTH_SSO_2026-04-22.md
   - Gate to next: SSO login endpoint live in staging, returns a
     session token compatible with existing dashboard middleware.
   - Status: complete
   - Epic-critic verdict: .arch_skill/arch-epic/critics/auth-sso/
     verdict.json (pass)

2. **Build admin dashboard backed by SSO**: New internal dashboard
   that authenticates via the SSO flow from sub-plan 1.
   - DOC_PATH: docs/ADMIN_DASHBOARD_2026-04-23.md
   - Gate to next: Admin dashboard live behind SSO for new users in
     staging.
   - Status: implementing
   - Epic-critic verdict: —

3. **Migrate existing admin users to SSO**: Cut over in-flight
   admins from email-password to SSO without session loss.
   - DOC_PATH: (not yet set)
   - Gate to next: (last sub-plan)
   - Status: pending
   - Epic-critic verdict: —
```

### Orchestration Log (append-only)

One line per significant event, prefixed with the ISO date. Written
by the skill, not the user. Examples of what goes here:

- Decomposition drafted and surfaced to user.
- User approved decomposition with adjustments: `<what changed>`.
- Sub-plan N invoked: `$arch-step new <DOC_PATH>`.
- Sub-plan N North Star approved by user.
- Sub-plan N auto-plan armed.
- Sub-plan N auto-plan completed (consistency-pass clean).
- Sub-plan N implement-loop armed.
- Sub-plan N implement-loop completed (arch-step audit COMPLETE).
- Epic critic run on sub-plan N: verdict=`<pass|scope_change|incomplete>`.
- Scope-change detected on sub-plan N: `<headline>`. Halted.
- User resolution on sub-plan N scope change: `<decision>`.
- Sub-plan N marked complete.
- Epic marked complete.

Never rewrite past entries. If an earlier entry was wrong, append a
correction; do not redact.

### Decision Log (append-only)

User-visible decisions about scope changes, punted items, renamed
sub-plans, reordered sub-plans. One entry per decision. Example:

```markdown
# Decision Log

- 2026-04-22 During sub-plan 1 (Ship SSO in the auth service)
  implementation, worklog surfaced that session token rotation needs
  a background job. Options presented: extend current sub-plan, new
  sub-plan, defer, drop. User chose: new sub-plan. Inserted as
  sub-plan 1.5 "Token rotation background job" between sub-plans 1
  and 2. Gate 1 → 1.5: rotation endpoint live. Gate 1.5 → 2: unchanged
  from original 1 → 2.
```

The Decision Log is the user-facing record of why the decomposition
looks the way it does after the fact. It should read like a
conversation history a month from now, not a machine log.

## Mutation rules

The skill mutates the epic doc under these conditions only:

- `start` mode: creates the doc with initial frontmatter, TL;DR, and
  the drafted Decomposition. Orchestration Log gets one entry.
- `approve-decomposition` mode: applies adjustments, flips
  `sub_plans_approved: true`, sets `status: active`, appends to log.
- `run` mode: updates sub-plan Status fields, fills in DOC_PATH when
  `$arch-step new` runs, appends to log, writes critic verdict
  pointer under the sub-plan entry.
- `resume-scope-change` mode: inserts a new sub-plan, or extends an
  existing one's scope, or marks items deferred/dropped; always
  appends a Decision Log entry.

The skill never edits `raw_goal` or `raw_goal_sha256` except at
`start`. If the user wants to edit the goal, they start a new epic;
the skill does not rewrite history in place.

## Validation on load

Every time the skill reads the epic doc, it validates:

1. Frontmatter parses as YAML with all required fields.
2. `raw_goal_sha256` matches a fresh hash of `raw_goal`.
3. `models_sha256` matches a fresh hash of the runtime/model/effort
   tuple.
4. The Decomposition section is present and non-empty if
   `sub_plans_approved: true`.
5. Every sub-plan entry has a Status; Status is one of the allowed
   values; sub-plans whose Status is beyond `pending` have a
   DOC_PATH set.
6. Orchestration Log and Decision Log are present (may be empty at
   `start`, always present after).

Validation failure is a loud error. The skill tells the user exactly
what is wrong and asks them to fix it manually — the skill does not
auto-repair the artifact.
