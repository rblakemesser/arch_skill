# Worker Prompt Contract

Prompt workers like capable colleagues entering cold. Give them enough truth to
move fast without turning them into brittle checklist executors.

## Include

- Mission: one slice outcome.
- Authoritative inputs: plan path, phase contract, swarm ledger slice, and
  relevant repo paths.
- Sibling context: other workers may be editing nearby code; do not revert
  unfamiliar changes.
- Success bar: behavior, tests, owner boundaries, cleanup, and proof needed.
- Verification intent: plan-required proof, changed/impacted surfaces that need
  confidence, tests already passing that should not be rerun unless affected,
  and any scarce verification lease.
- Freedom: workers may inspect adjacent owning code and make necessary
  task-relevant edits.
- Native parallelism: "Maximize parallelism with native subagents or
  parallel-agent features provided by your current coding harness. Do not
  manually spawn separate coding-harness executables, or invoke skills whose
  main effect is to shell out to `codex`, `claude`, `agent`, or `grok`, from
  inside this child prompt unless the parent explicitly assigns that action."
- Parent hints: likely fix paths, suspected files, and evidence to inspect are
  advisory, not a script. The worker still owns the implementation judgment.
- Constraint: do not broaden product scope, push, stash, or revert unrelated
  work. Parent owns commit checkpoints unless this worker prompt explicitly
  assigns you one.

## Avoid

- Micromanaged file-by-file scripts.
- "Do not touch anything else" guardrails that prevent required adjacent fixes.
- Large copied plan sections when a path and heading is enough.
- Asking workers to run scarce full-suite checks without a lease and a concrete
  reason tied to the plan, changed/impacted surfaces, stale proof, or review
  findings.
- Asking the parent to rerun implementation tests as the normal proof path.
- Treating workers as checklist executors. They are engineers responsible for
  real implementation within the slice mission.
