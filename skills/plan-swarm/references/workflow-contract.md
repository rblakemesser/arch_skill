# Workflow Contract

`plan-swarm` turns one approved plan phase into a parallel implementation loop.
It does not write a new plan or broaden the requested boundary.

## Parent Agent Owns Orchestration

- Interpret the plan phase and applicable Definition of Done.
- Recover missing execution detail from owning code, tests, schemas, generated
  artifacts, and current behavior.
- Write the phase contract and swarm ledger next to the plan.
- Use `$agent-delegate` to launch and resume implementation workers.
- Write worker, arbiter, and repair prompts with prompt-authoring discipline.
- Inspect worker reports, changed files, and proof after every batch.
- Commit local progress checkpoints freely, including dirty inherited work that
  looks like resumed plan work.
- Coordinate expensive validation so workers do not stampede the same resource.
- Decide whether a review finding is accepted, rejected, or deferred.
- Decide whether to resume a worker, spawn fresh, pause, or ask the user.

## Coordination Shape

Parallelism is part of the parent agent's normal work: reason about
independence, launch workers with the existing delegation skill, inspect the
real worktree, and keep a human ledger. Any optional helper belongs below that
judgment layer as a narrow utility, such as a blank ledger template or stale
wording check.

## Lifecycle

1. Intake: plan path, phase, stop boundary, work root, implementation policy,
   review policy, and max parallelism.
2. Initial/resume checkpoint: inspect `git status` and commit tracked changes
   plus likely relevant untracked files before worker launch. Skip only
   concrete safety issues such as secrets, obvious machine-local junk, or files
   clearly unrelated to the repo.
3. Phase contract: source-of-truth requirements and proof obligations.
4. Swarm ledger: independent/dependent slices, likely collisions, scarce
   resources, assigned workers, session ids, and proof needed.
5. Implementation batches: launch independent slices in parallel through
   `$agent-delegate`.
6. Merge/evidence checkpoint: read worker reports, inspect repo state, and
   commit meaningful landed progress.
7. Arbiter loop: delegated observation-only review against the phase contract.
8. Thermonuclear gate: strict maintainability review and triage.
9. Repair checkpoint: commit accepted review repairs after verification.
10. Final report: evidence, findings, remaining gaps, final local commit
    checkpoint, and stop at boundary.

## Git Posture

Local commits are normal plan-swarm checkpoints, not polished PR history. Bias
toward getting useful work committed instead of pausing for Git ceremony. The
user can squash, reorder, or clean commits before opening a PR.

The parent agent owns commits by default. Parallel workers should not race to
commit unless the parent explicitly assigns one worker a commit checkpoint.
Never push, open PRs, stash, or revert unrelated work unless the user asks for
that exact operation.

## Stop Discipline

- Stop after the named phase unless the user asked for a phase range or whole
  plan.
- Whole-plan final review is only for whole-plan completion or explicit final
  signoff.
- Do not use worker success footers as completion proof by themselves.
