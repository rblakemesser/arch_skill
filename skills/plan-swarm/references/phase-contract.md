# Phase Contract

The phase contract is the small source-of-truth brief every worker and reviewer
can read without absorbing the whole plan.

## Required Fields

- Plan path
- Active phase heading
- Stop boundary
- Target state
- In-scope surfaces
- Out-of-scope surfaces
- Owner boundaries
- Cleanup obligations
- Validation obligations
- Save, persistence, or QA behavior obligations
- Applicable Definition of Done excerpts
- Recovered code/test/schema facts
- Unknowns workers may resolve from repo evidence
- Unknowns requiring user input

## Extraction Rules

- Read the active phase and nearby plan-level Definition of Done before
  editing.
- If the phase is high-level, recover the real contract from owning code,
  tests, schemas, generated artifacts, current behavior, and local
  instructions.
- Recovered facts support execution; they do not expand approved product scope.
- Keep the contract compact. Link to long plan sections instead of pasting them
  into every child prompt.
- Write the contract next to the plan so workers and reviewers share one
  readable briefing.

## Completion Bar

A phase is complete only when the contract is covered by implementation
evidence, required cleanup is done or explicitly walled off by the plan,
verification is proportional, review findings are triaged, and the requested
boundary has not been exceeded.
