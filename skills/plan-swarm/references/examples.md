## Cursor Agent Phase Run

User intent:

```text
Finish Phase 14 from docs/PACKS/example-plan.md using Cursor Agent workers.
```

Parent setup note:

```text
Implementation: Cursor Agent, model composer-2.5-fast, max parallel 4.
Review: Codex gpt-5.4 xhigh unless user asks for the same runtime.
Artifacts: docs/PACKS/example-plan_plan_swarm/phase-14/.
```

## Progress Update

```markdown
### Phase Progress

| Phase | Scope | % | Status | Evidence | Note |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 14 | command metadata, QA adapters, overlays, persistence cleanup | 45% | implementing | contract + 3 active slices | Review not started. |

### Current Phase Work Slices

| Slice | Goal | Worker | Parallelization | Status | Proof |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| qa-adapters | Move QA registration to feature-owned adapters. | worker-a | Independent from overlay cleanup; shared QA boundary only. | running | owner-boundary tests |
| command-service | Route execution through command service/session. | worker-b | Serial before legacy deletion. | running | command execution tests |
| overlay-save | Remove raw writer/provider calls in overlays. | worker-c | Parallel with QA adapters; watches command-service API. | running | overlay save checks |
| legacy-cleanup | Delete or wall off direct mutation paths. | waiting | Depends on command-service replacement. | pending | deletion checkpoint |

### Workers Now

| Worker | Runtime/Model | Slice | State | Current Task | Session |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| worker-a | agent/composer-2.5-fast | qa-adapters | executing | Feature QA registration | s-qa |
| worker-b | agent/composer-2.5-fast | command-service | executing | Session execution path | s-cmd |
| worker-c | agent/composer-2.5-fast | overlay-save | executing | Overlay persistence calls | s-overlay |
```

## Worker Prompt Skeleton

```text
Use $agent-delegate with Cursor Agent composer-2.5-fast.

Finish the "qa-adapters" slice from docs/PACKS/example-plan_plan_swarm/phase-14/swarm-ledger.md.

Read the phase contract first. The plan doc remains source of truth. Other
workers may be editing sibling slices, so do not revert unfamiliar changes.
You may inspect adjacent owning code and make task-relevant edits needed to
complete this slice.

Do not broaden product scope, commit, push, stash, or run the full suite unless
the parent assigns that verification resource.

End with the required plan-swarm worker footer.
```

## Review Triage

```text
Accepted:
- boundary-leak: route to qa-adapters worker; directly violates owner-boundary requirement.

Rejected:
- none

Deferred:
- old-naming-debt: real debt, but outside the named phase.
```
