# Commit History Authoring

Use this skill when the user wants the current branch's commit history rewritten
from the point where it diverged from its nearest parent branch, so the commit
stream explains the work clearly.

Default behavior is message-only: preserve every patch, tree snapshot, commit
boundary, and commit order. Do not squash, split, reorder, push, force-push, or
rewrite parent/shared history.

This skill ships one script because the dangerous part is deterministic Git
safety. The agent authors the messages; `scripts/rewrite_commit_messages.py`
only inspects and applies a safe message-only rewrite.

## When to use

- The user wants `WIP`, vague, or placeholder commits re-authored into useful
  branch commit messages.
- The user wants current-branch history to tell the story of what changed from
  its parent branch before sharing, opening a PR, or handing the branch to
  someone else.
- The user wants active arch-plan context called out in commit bodies when the
  repo provides real evidence of that plan.
- The user asks to make the commit stream maximally informative while keeping
  the branch's actual code changes intact.

## When not to use

- The target commits are reachable from parent branches or unrelated remote
  refs. The current branch's own remote-tracking ref is allowed.
- The user wants a PR title/body. Use `$pr-authoring`.
- The user wants a changelog, release notes, or docs narrative instead of Git
  history.
- The user wants a findings-first review. Use `$code-review`.
- The user wants to squash, split, reorder, drop, or combine commits. Treat
  that as a separate higher-risk history-editing task, not this default flow.
- The repo has no concrete branch-span commit range to rewrite.

## Non-negotiables

- Work from repo truth: current branch, inferred parent/base, branch-span
  commits, commit diffs, old messages, trailers, active arch-plan evidence, and
  repo instructions.
- Default target range is the current branch's linear commit span from
  `merge-base(parent, HEAD)..HEAD`, using `merge-base --fork-point` when Git can
  prove a better fork point.
- Allow commits reachable from the current branch's own remote-tracking refs,
  such as `origin/<current-branch>`. Block commits reachable from unrelated
  remote refs.
- Require a clean worktree and index before applying a rewrite.
- Infer the nearest parent branch by default. Use `--parent <ref>` for an
  explicit parent branch, or `--base <ref>` for an exact boundary override.
- Preserve commit boundaries and patch content by default. Never use squash,
  split, reorder, cherry-pick cleanup, or interactive rebase unless the user
  explicitly asks for that different workflow.
- Create a backup branch before moving the current branch.
- Preserve author metadata and existing trailers such as `Co-authored-by`,
  `Signed-off-by`, `Change-Id`, `Reviewed-by`, and `Fixes`.
- Never invent intent, ticket numbers, tests, reviewers, plan paths, or phase
  status.
- Never push or force-push. Return the local rewrite receipt, recovery command,
  and note when publishing rewritten branch history would require an explicit
  user-requested force-with-lease step outside this default action.

## First move

1. Read `references/git-safety.md`.
2. Read `references/message-quality.md`.
3. Run inspect mode from the repo root:
   ```bash
   python3 skills/commit-history-authoring/scripts/rewrite_commit_messages.py inspect --repo .
   ```
   If the user supplied a parent branch, add `--parent <ref>`. If the user
   supplied an exact boundary, add `--base <ref>`.
4. Resolve active arch-plan evidence from, in order:
   - an explicit `docs/<...>.md` path from the user
   - current controller state under `.codex/` or `.claude/arch_skill/`
   - a single strong canonical docs candidate with full-arch markers
5. If multiple credible plan candidates remain, ask the user to choose from the
   top candidates. Otherwise proceed with `active arch plan: none`.

## Workflow

1. **Inspect safety.** Use the helper's inspect output plus `git status`,
   `git log`, and `git show` as needed. Stop on any unsafe state.
2. **Map each commit.** For every branch-span commit, read the old message,
   changed files, stats, and diff enough to understand what the commit did and
   why it belongs as its own step.
3. **Draft messages.** Write one message file per commit using the full SHA
   filename expected by the helper: `<messages-dir>/<old-sha>.msg`.
4. **Validate the story.** Read the messages in order and check that the stream
   explains the branch, preserves trailers, calls out evidenced arch-plan
   context, and does not overclaim.
5. **Apply only when asked to rewrite.** If the user's request is only a
   review, preview, or proposal, stop after showing the proposed messages.
   Otherwise run:
   ```bash
   python3 skills/commit-history-authoring/scripts/rewrite_commit_messages.py apply --repo . --messages-dir <messages-dir>
   ```
   Add the same `--parent <ref>` or `--base <ref>` used during inspect.
6. **Report the receipt.** Include rewritten commit count, backup branch,
   old/new head, active arch plan used or `none`, verification result, and the
   recovery command.

## Quality bar

- Great commit streams let a future reader understand the problem, the
  implementation sequence, and the plan context without opening every diff.
- Subjects are specific, imperative, and scoped to the commit's actual change.
- Bodies explain why the step exists when the subject alone is not enough.
- Arch-plan callouts are concrete and evidenced, for example
  `Arch plan: docs/PLAN.md, phase 2`. Missing evidence stays unmentioned.
- Weak output merely replaces `WIP` with generic polish, repeats filenames,
  invents motivation, drops trailers, or rewrites code history while pretending
  it only rewrote messages.

## Output expectations

- On success: return a compact receipt with the backup branch and recovery
  command.
- On blocked rewrite: name the exact safety blocker and the next concrete step
  required before retrying.
- On preview-only work: return the proposed messages and say no history was
  rewritten.
- Do not include a force-push command unless the user asks how to publish
  rewritten branch history; even then, frame it as outside this skill's action.

## Reference map

- `references/git-safety.md` - branch-span rewrite boundary, parent inference,
  blocked states, backup/recovery, and script contract
- `references/message-quality.md` - informative message shape, active arch-plan
  handling, trailer preservation, and anti-patterns
