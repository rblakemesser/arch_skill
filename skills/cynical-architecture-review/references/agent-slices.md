# Native Agent Slices

Use native parallel agents when the target is broad enough that independent
read-only review lanes will improve coverage. The parent owns synthesis,
verdict, and the saved artifact.

Do not manually spawn external coding-harness executables. Do not invoke
external delegation, consult, or review skills as the mechanism.

## When To Split

Split when two or more of these are true:

- the target covers a broad branch, diff, subsystem, plan-backed
  implementation, or architecture area
- more than one owner path may exist
- old and new architecture both need tracing
- the intended UX, hard constraints, and current code owners need separate
  inspection
- state, config, generated artifacts, prompt/skill surfaces, or install
  surfaces changed with runtime code
- the user explicitly asked for agents or parallel review

Do not split a tiny review just to perform ceremony. A single careful pass is
fine when all relevant code fits in one reviewer's head.

## Parent Responsibilities

The parent must:

- write the architecture story before splitting
- give each slice a concrete read-only job
- tell slices to cite files and code paths they actually read
- keep slices from doing implementation or patch design
- keep slices from drifting into QA/test/docs review unless that is their
  explicitly assigned architecture-evidence lane
- wait for every launched slice to reach a final state
- synthesize duplicate findings into one required repair
- record gaps honestly in `coverage.md`

Every launched slice ends as exactly one of:

- `findings`
- `no-findings`
- `coverage-gap`
- `failed`
- `intentionally-stopped`, with the reason

Do not silently drop a slice. A missing slice result is a coverage gap.

## Slice Prompt Shape

Use this shape and adapt the target details:

```text
You are one read-only reviewer in a cynical architecture review.

Target:
- Repository/root:
- Review scope:
- Architecture story being tested:
- Intended UX and hard constraints:
- Files or paths you should prioritize:

Posture:
- Assume the architecture may have emerged accidentally through iteration.
- Current code behavior is authority for what exists.
- Intended UX and hard constraints are authority for what must keep existing.
- Do not edit files.
- Do not drift into QA/test/docs review unless those surfaces expose
  architecture ownership, stale truth, or future-copy risk.

Your job:
- <one slice-specific job>

Return:
- result: findings | no-findings | coverage-gap | failed
- files-read:
- code-paths-traced:
- findings:
- coverage-gaps:
```

This is a prose contract, not a machine protocol.

## Useful Slices

### `ux_requirement_mapper`

Map the user's intended experience, hard constraints, experiment requirements,
and non-requirements.

Ask:

- What behavior must stay unchanged?
- What experiment or compatibility constraints are real?
- Which claimed requirements are assumptions or future bets?
- What complexity sources are not forced by the user job?

### `owner_invariant_mapper`

Map current owners, invariants, state models, lifecycle rules, and caller
obligations.

Ask:

- Who owns creation, validation, mutation, rendering, persistence, routing, and
  cleanup?
- Where does each invariant live?
- What must callers remember?
- Which owner boundaries are invalid or split?

### `old_path_duplicate_truth_hunter`

Search for legacy authority paths, duplicate truths, same-contract siblings,
fallback readers or writers, direct mutation paths, aliases, schemas, fixtures,
generated artifacts, prompt surfaces, and configs.

Ask:

- What old path still expresses the same concept?
- Can behavior still enter through it?
- Does it delegate to one owner or remain its own authority?
- Can future work update one truth and leave another stale?

### `abstraction_complexity_reviewer`

Find accidental abstractions, wrappers, managers, registries, adapters, policy
layers, generic machinery, and architecture theater.

Ask:

- What live concepts did this add?
- What requirement forces those concepts?
- Does the abstraction hide a dangerous boundary or just launder confusion?
- What can be deleted, inlined, collapsed, or moved to an existing owner?

### `state_config_reviewer`

Inspect state spread, feature flags as architecture, config-as-programming,
mode matrices, generated truth, and sync points.

Ask:

- Is one domain state represented by multiple booleans, configs, stores, or
  generated artifacts?
- Does a flag choose between owners instead of behavior inside one owner?
- Is config encoding logic that belongs in code?
- Can invalid combinations become unrepresentable?

### `future_copy_surface_reviewer`

Read docs, tests, examples, fixtures, prompts, generated artifacts, comments,
and metadata only where they can teach future work the wrong architecture.

Ask:

- Does a test mock the boundary that should be real?
- Does an example route through an old owner?
- Does generated truth disagree with code?
- Would a future agent copy this accidental architecture?

Do not emit doc hygiene, missing-test, or QA findings. The blocker is the
architecture lie or future-copy trap.

## Slice Finding Shape

Slice findings should be compact:

```markdown
### <short title>

- File: <repo-relative path>
- Architecture story being tested:
- Code evidence:
- Why this architecture appears accidental or unjustified:
- Requirement / UX preserved:
- Simpler architecture direction:
- Pattern:
```

The parent converts accepted slice findings into the final output contract.
