# Depth-First Planning Doctrine

Use this reference when an arch-series skill writes, repairs, implements, or
audits phased plans. The purpose is to protect the full destination while
proving the architecture early, not to make the plan smaller or looser.

## The mental model

Depth-first planning has five planning objects:

- `Destination map`: the frozen implementation scope: the human-authorized
  outcome plus the initial minimal convergence closure established before
  implementation. It is preserved across TL;DR, Section 0, target
  architecture, call-site audit, approved decisions, and the phase plan. It is
  not the Phase 1 checklist, and later agent discoveries do not enlarge it.
- `First working slice`: the narrowest real end-to-end path that proves the
  canonical owner path, hardest risk-bearing seam, compatibility or migration
  posture, and verification shape on real inputs. It is not a stub, fake demo,
  unused foundation layer, or special-case path.
- `Expansion map`: the ordered delivery of breadth already present in the
  frozen destination map after the first slice works. It names later axes such
  as more callers, data states, surfaces, formats, migrations, user flows,
  compatibility cases, or rollout coverage. It is sequencing, not permission
  for reviewers or workers to add scope.
- `Proof gate`: the evidence that a phase or sub-plan is safe to build on. It
  answers what later work can now rely on.
- `Scope cut`: a removal, downgrade, or optionalizing of destination-map scope.
  It requires explicit user approval and a `Scope cut (user-approved)` Decision
  Log entry.

Apply `scope-and-convergence.md` before freezing the destination
map. Initial plan architecture may include the smallest same-contract cutover
needed to avoid competing authority. Once implementation begins, only a human
decision owner may expand the map; a newly discovered adjacent path is a
finding to disposition, not an automatic expansion.

The WHY: breadth-first plans feel complete because many final surfaces appear
early, but they defer the highest-risk learning until the blast radius is large.
Depth-first plans keep final scope visible while forcing one real path to work
before expanding breadth.

## Phase and sub-plan count

Count is an outcome, not a target. Do not start with three, five, seven, or
`3-7` and squeeze the work to fit.

Create a phase or sub-plan boundary when there is a real dependency edge, proof
gate, reversibility boundary, migration boundary, or user-review boundary. Split
when one unit blends separately provable work. Merge when a unit only moves
files, creates unused scaffolding, or proves nothing later work can rely on.

The useful version of phase splitting is only this: split blended work at the
proof gate. The useful version of an epic count range is only this: a long list
is a cognitive-load smell, not a target range.

## Audit states

Apply these states when implementing, auditing, or reviewing epic scope:

- Missing approved current scope: fail. The work was due in the current
  approved frontier and is not done.
- Scheduled later expansion: pass for now when the destination-map obligation
  remains visible and is assigned to a named later phase or sub-plan whose proof
  gate is not yet due.
- Silent scope reduction: fail unless the user explicitly approved the cut. A
  vague "later", "defer", "out of scope", "MVP", or dropped obligation is not
  scheduled expansion.
- Post-freeze agent expansion: fail. A worker, review, audit, or verifier added
  work that was absent from the frozen destination map and lacks later human
  approval. Subtract it, redesign inside the frozen boundary, or ask the human
  to approve and re-freeze the expanded scope.

## Failure modes

Use these as recognition tests, not keyword rules:

- Final-form Phase 1: the first phase builds the production version of one
  whole surface or layer, then later phases repeat that shape elsewhere.
- Fake foundations: the plan builds abstractions, schemas, helpers, prompts, or
  harnesses that no real path exercises.
- Layer cake planning: phases are split as data, service, UI, polish, or
  similar layers, and no phase produces a working vertical until the end.
- Preset phase count: the plan chooses a count before mapping proof gates.
- Everything-everywhere checklist: the destination map is copied into Phase 1.
- Expansion treated as cut: a later destination item is failed even though it is
  visibly carried by a named later phase or sub-plan.
- Cut hidden as expansion: approved destination scope disappears under vague
  "later" language without a named owner and proof gate.
- Toy MVP: the first slice is narrow but not real enough for later phases to
  build on.

## Section 7 guidance

Keep the existing Section 7 shape. Do not introduce mandatory `Destination
Map`, `First Working Slice`, or `Expansion Map` headings. Instead, make the
phase `Goal`, `Work`, `Checklist`, `Verification`, and `Exit criteria` show:

- which destination-map obligation this phase protects
- which real slice or expansion axis this phase owns
- which proof gate says the next phase can rely on it
- which later named phase owns any scheduled breadth not due now

The phase plan remains the single execution checklist. The destination map is
not a competing checklist, and the expansion map is not a junk drawer.
