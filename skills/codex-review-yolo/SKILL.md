# codex-review-yolo

Use this skill when the user wants an independent review from the locally-installed `codex` CLI using profile `yolo`. The artifact can be code, a doc, a plan, a rollout, or a claimed completion state. The value is that codex runs as a separate agent with zero session history — it must read the artifacts itself, so its verdict is genuinely independent.

This skill is intentionally narrow in mechanism, not in review subject. It teaches the invocation pattern, the prompt shape that makes codex actually read the authoritative artifacts, and how to consume the verdict. It does not wrap every possible codex use case.

## When to use

- User says any of: "review with codex", "audit this with codex", "get a second opinion from codex", "run codex -p yolo", "have codex audit my work".
- User has just finished non-trivial work (diff, multi-commit change, implementation-plan phase, design doc, rollout) and wants fresh eyes before a next step such as merge, ship, execute, share, or mark-complete.
- User wants an adversarial / skeptical review from a model that doesn't share your blind spots.
- User wants an external audit of whether explicit claims, checklist items, or completion targets were actually met.

## When not to use

- The user wants codex to *write* code, not review it. This skill is review-only.
- The user wants a quick yes/no on a one-line change — the setup cost exceeds the value.
- The user has not yet produced a concrete artifact, claims list, or completion target to review. Don't spin up codex on vapor.
- `codex` is not installed on the host — `which codex` returns nothing. Stop and tell the user.

## Non-negotiables

- **Run codex with `-p yolo` explicitly.** The profile carries gpt-5.4 + xhigh reasoning + fast service tier + `danger-full-access` sandbox. Any other profile changes the contract.
- **Use `codex exec` (non-interactive), not `codex` (interactive TUI).** You are orchestrating, not babysitting a session.
- **Brief codex like a colleague who just walked in.** It has no memory of your session. Name the review goal, the authoritative artifacts, any claims or completion targets, and what you want checked.
- **Require a structured verdict block at the end.** Without it, codex drifts into narrative and you cannot act on the result.
- **Treat the prompt examples as examples.** Adapt the sections to the actual review objective instead of cargo-culting one review mode.
- **Never pass secrets in the prompt.** If codex needs `FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN` or similar, source `.env` into the codex env and instruct codex to read it from the environment.
- **Run in the background for non-trivial audits.** Codex at xhigh takes minutes. Kick it off with `run_in_background: true` so you can keep working.
- **Namespace every run's files.** Derive one run-specific directory or prefix and keep the prompt, final output, and stream log inside it so concurrent runs on the same machine never clobber each other.
- **Capture output to a file.** The final-message file is the consumable deliverable; the stream log is diagnostic.
- **Trust but verify.** Codex can be wrong. Spot-check any blocking finding by reading the cited file before acting on it.

## First move

1. Confirm `codex` exists and the `yolo` profile is defined: `which codex && grep -A2 '^\[profiles.yolo\]' ~/.codex/config.toml`.
2. Identify the exact review objective and authoritative artifacts: commit SHA(s), branch, file paths, doc paths, checklist items, or plan phases. Write them down in the prompt.
3. Create a namespaced run directory once and reuse it for every file in that invocation. Example:

   ```bash
   REVIEW_SLUG="phase-b-completion"
   RUN_TS="$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)"
   RUN_DIR="$(mktemp -d "/tmp/codex-review-${REVIEW_SLUG}-${RUN_TS}-XXXXXX")"
   PROMPT_PATH="$RUN_DIR/prompt.md"
   FINAL_PATH="$RUN_DIR/final.txt"
   STREAM_PATH="$RUN_DIR/stream.log"
   ```

4. If the review needs API tokens, confirm `.env` has them and plan to `set -a; source .env; set +a` before invoking.
5. Draft the prompt to `$PROMPT_PATH` (never inline — prompts get long and multi-line is inevitable).
6. Invoke via `codex exec -p yolo -C <repo-root> -o "$FINAL_PATH" < "$PROMPT_PATH" > "$STREAM_PATH" 2>&1`, in background.
7. Continue other work while codex reasons; when it completes, read `$FINAL_PATH` and relay the verdict to the user.

## Workflow

### 1. Shape the prompt

A good prompt for codex review has these sections, in this order:

1. **Role + posture.** One line. "You are auditing X. Be skeptical. If the work is wrong, say so plainly."
2. **Review objective + ground truth.** State what approval means for this review and point codex at the authoritative artifacts. Be specific — codex has no context.
3. **Claims / expected outcomes / completion targets.** Summarize the claims, checklist items, or expected outcomes you want audited. If there are none, say that explicitly.
4. **What to check.** Numbered list. Each item names a specific concern and where codex should look.
5. **Tooling hints.** If codex needs external APIs (e.g. Figma REST), tell it the endpoint shape and where the token lives (env var, not inline value).
6. **Verdict block requirement.** Demand a specific footer format so the result is machine-ish-readable.

See `references/prompt-template.md` for the full skeleton.

### 2. Invoke codex

Example pattern, adjust the repo root, review slug, and paths:

```bash
REVIEW_SLUG="phase-b-completion"
REPO_ROOT="$(pwd)"
RUN_TS="$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)"
RUN_DIR="$(mktemp -d "/tmp/codex-review-${REVIEW_SLUG}-${RUN_TS}-XXXXXX")"
PROMPT_PATH="$RUN_DIR/prompt.md"
FINAL_PATH="$RUN_DIR/final.txt"
STREAM_PATH="$RUN_DIR/stream.log"

# If the audit needs API tokens, source them into the codex environment.
if [ -f "$REPO_ROOT/.env" ]; then set -a; source "$REPO_ROOT/.env"; set +a; fi

codex exec -p yolo \
  -C "$REPO_ROOT" \
  -o "$FINAL_PATH" \
  < "$PROMPT_PATH" \
  > "$STREAM_PATH" 2>&1
```

Key flags:

- `-p yolo` — the profile. Non-negotiable.
- `-C <dir>` — the working root. Use the repo root (or the submodule root if that's the reviewed unit).
- `-o <file>` — writes the final assistant message to this file. This is what you Read at the end.
- `< prompt.md` — feeds the prompt via stdin. Keeps command lines sane and lets you iterate on prompts in a file.
- `> stream.log 2>&1` — captures the full event stream. Use for diagnosis if codex errored or went sideways.
- `$RUN_DIR/...` — keeps one review invocation's artifacts isolated from every other invocation.

Run via the Bash tool with `run_in_background: true` for any audit you expect to take more than ~30 seconds. The final-message file is created when codex exits.

### 3. Consume the verdict

When codex finishes:

1. Read the run's final output file, e.g. `$FINAL_PATH`.
2. Locate the `VERDICT:` / `BLOCKING:` / `NON-BLOCKING:` footer.
3. Relay findings to the user. Do not blindly trust — spot-check any blocking claim against the actual file before acting.
4. If codex found nothing actionable, say so directly. Don't manufacture issues to justify the invocation.

## Output expectations

- A short summary to the user: what codex's verdict was, what blocking issues it found (if any), and whether you agree after verification.
- The full final-output file stays on disk in its namespaced run directory — mention the path so the user can read the full review if they want.
- Never claim codex said something it didn't. If the output is ambiguous, say "codex was ambiguous on X" and ask the user how to proceed.

## Reference map

- `references/prompt-template.md` — full skeleton for the review prompt, plus clearly-labeled examples for diff review, implementation completion, plan review, and cross-repo review
- `references/verdict-contract.md` — the exact footer format and how to parse it
- `references/troubleshooting.md` — common failure modes (no output, rate-limit, truncation, codex can't find files)
