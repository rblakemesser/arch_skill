# Model And Invocation

Use this reference to resolve what the user meant by "Claude", "Codex",
"Cursor Agent", "opus high", "gpt 5.5 xhigh", "composer-2.5-fast", or similar
phrasing, and to run the selected fresh subprocess or explicit parallel group
of fresh subprocesses.

## Required Values

Every consult child needs three execution values:

- `runtime` - `claude`, `codex`, or `agent`
- `model` - the runnable CLI model identifier
- `effort` - the reasoning effort level

If any value is missing or ambiguous, ask one consolidated question before
invoking:

```text
I need the fresh consult runtime, model, and effort before invoking an external
model. The consult runs as a clean subprocess and can spend real model budget.
What should I use?
```

Add only the missing facts to the question when some values are already known.

## Runtime Inference

Infer runtime only when the user's wording makes it unambiguous:

- `codex`, `gpt`, `gpt-5.5`, `gpt 5.5 high`, or `gpt-5.3-codex` implies
  `runtime=codex`.
- `claude`, `opus`, `sonnet`, or `haiku` implies `runtime=claude`.
- `agent`, `cursor`, `cursor agent`, or `cursor-agent` implies
  `runtime=agent`. Cursor Agent may run `gpt-*` or `claude-*` model ids; the
  runtime name wins over the model-family token.
- If the user names only an effort level, such as "xhigh", ask for runtime and
  model.
- If the user says only "run a fresh consult" or "get a second opinion", ask
  for runtime, model, and effort.

Do not choose a favorite default. The selected model changes both cost and
quality, so the user supplies it.

## Model Phrase Resolution

Treat model text as intent, not a loose alias:

- Preserve model family and numeric version exactly. `gpt 5.5` may normalize to
  `gpt-5.5`; it must not become `gpt-5.4`. `opus 4.7` may normalize to
  `claude-opus-4-7`; it must not become another Opus version.
- If the user says `gpt 5.4` or a `gpt-5.4` variant while choosing a model,
  pause before execution and ask whether they meant `gpt-5.5` or explicitly
  want `gpt-5.4`. This is an intent check, not an alias rule: do not rewrite
  the version yourself.
- For Codex, inspect `codex debug models` when needed and choose an available
  identifier with the same family and exact version. If no exact match exists
  or multiple matches are plausible, ask for the runnable model id.
- For Claude, when the runtime is Claude and the user names family plus
  version, prefer `claude-<family>-<version-with-hyphens>`, for example
  `claude-opus-4-7` or `claude-sonnet-4-6`.
- Family-only Claude aliases such as `opus`, `sonnet`, or `haiku` are allowed
  only when the user did not pin a version.
- For Cursor Agent, use an exact runnable id from `agent models` or
  `agent --list-models`. Cursor effort is encoded in model ids, so do not
  invent a separate effort flag.
- Do not run paid trial prompts to discover whether a Claude model exists. Use
  the CLI help/config surface when available; otherwise ask.

Always announce the raw-to-resolved mapping before execution:

```text
Claude Opus 4.7 xhigh -> runtime=claude, model=claude-opus-4-7, effort=xhigh
```

For deterministic script plumbing that needs the same rules, use
`skills/_shared/model_resolution.py` instead of creating a local model alias
table. The helper exists to keep fresh-consult, Stepwise-style orchestrators,
and arch-epic automatic harnesses aligned on exact-version preservation and
fail-loud behavior.

## Effort Resolution

- Claude accepts `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max` via `--effort`.
- Codex effort is passed as `-c model_reasoning_effort='"<level>"'`.
- Cursor Agent does not expose a separate `--effort` flag in the local CLI.
  Store effort as `encoded-in-model` or `encoded-in-model:<requested-effort>`
  and pass only `--model "<resolved_agent_model>"`.
- For Codex, confirm the selected model supports the requested effort when
  `codex debug models` is needed for model resolution.
- If the effort is missing or the selected model does not support it, ask.

## Run Directory

Create one run directory per consult child:

```bash
CONSULT_SLUG="<short-slug>"
RUN_TS="$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)"
RUN_DIR="$(mktemp -d "/tmp/fresh-consult/${CONSULT_SLUG}-${RUN_TS}-XXXXXX")"
PROMPT_PATH="$RUN_DIR/prompt.md"
FINAL_PATH="$RUN_DIR/final.txt"
EVENTS_PATH="$RUN_DIR/events.jsonl"
STDERR_PATH="$RUN_DIR/stderr.log"
```

Write the prompt to `prompt.md`. Do not pass a long multiline prompt directly
on the command line.

`events.jsonl` is the live child stream. `stderr.log` is the diagnostic error
stream. `final.txt` is the final assistant text: Codex writes it directly with
`-o`; for Claude and Cursor Agent, copy the `result` text from the final
`type=result` event after the process exits.

## Parallel Consult Group

Use the parallel group path only when the user asks for parallel consults or
gives multiple consult questions for this skill. Parallel consults are still
ordinary fresh consult children; the group only gives the parent a place to
organize prompts, streams, finals, and the combined report.

Create one group directory:

```bash
GROUP_SLUG="<short-slug>"
RUN_TS="$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)"
GROUP_DIR="$(mktemp -d "/tmp/fresh-consult/parallel-${GROUP_SLUG}-${RUN_TS}-XXXXXX")"
```

For each child, create an ordinary child run directory beneath the group:

```bash
CHILD_SLUG="<child-slug>"
RUN_DIR="$GROUP_DIR/$CHILD_SLUG"
mkdir -p "$RUN_DIR"
PROMPT_PATH="$RUN_DIR/prompt.md"
FINAL_PATH="$RUN_DIR/final.txt"
EVENTS_PATH="$RUN_DIR/events.jsonl"
STDERR_PATH="$RUN_DIR/stderr.log"
```

Launch each child with the same Codex, Claude, or Cursor Agent command shape
below, using that child's paths. Record the shell PID and exit status in the
child directory if the host shell makes that convenient, but do not introduce a
script, controller, detached monitor, or state machine.

Default to one shared runtime/model/effort for all children. If the user clearly
assigns different execution choices to different children, apply those choices
exactly and announce the mapping before launch. If any child lacks a consult
question, work root, runtime, model, or effort, ask one consolidated question
before launching the group.

Wait for all children before reporting. If one child fails or returns malformed
output, preserve its run directory and include that failure in the group report;
do not discard the successful sibling consults.

## Codex Command

Use this shape for a Codex consult:

```bash
codex exec \
  --ephemeral \
  --disable codex_hooks \
  -C "<work_root>" \
  --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox \
  --skip-git-repo-check \
  --model "<resolved_model>" \
  -c model_reasoning_effort='"<resolved_effort>"' \
  --json \
  -o "$FINAL_PATH" \
  < "$PROMPT_PATH" \
  > "$EVENTS_PATH" \
  2> "$STDERR_PATH"
```

Flag meanings:

- `--ephemeral` keeps the child stateless and cold.
- `--disable codex_hooks` prevents hook recursion.
- `-C <work_root>` pins the filesystem context.
- `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` gives the child realistic local
  access. Use only in trusted local environments.
- `--skip-git-repo-check` allows doc or artifact consults outside a git root.
- `--json` streams Codex event JSONL to `events.jsonl` while the child works.
- `-o "$FINAL_PATH"` captures the final assistant message.

## Claude Command

Use this shape for a Claude consult:

```bash
claude -p \
  --output-format stream-json \
  --verbose \
  --include-partial-messages \
  --include-hook-events \
  --dangerously-skip-permissions \
  --settings '{"disableAllHooks":true}' \
  --model "<resolved_model>" \
  --effort "<resolved_effort>" \
  < "$PROMPT_PATH" \
  > "$EVENTS_PATH" \
  2> "$STDERR_PATH"
```

Flag meanings:

- `-p` runs non-interactively and exits.
- `--output-format stream-json` emits live JSONL events to `events.jsonl`.
- `--verbose` is required by the Claude CLI when `stream-json` output is used.
- `--include-partial-messages` and `--include-hook-events` preserve progress
  and tool/hook activity for long consults.
- `--dangerously-skip-permissions` gives the child realistic local access. Use
  only in trusted local environments.
- `--settings '{"disableAllHooks":true}'` prevents hook recursion.
- `--model` and `--effort` pin the execution choice.

After Claude exits, read the final `type=result` event from `events.jsonl` and
write its `result` text to `final.txt` before applying the verdict-footer
checks. If no result event exists after a zero exit, treat the run as malformed
and preserve the run directory.

## Cursor Agent Command

Use this shape for a Cursor Agent consult. Cursor Agent has no `--verbose`
flag; that flag is Claude-only.

```bash
agent -p \
  --mode ask \
  --output-format stream-json \
  --trust \
  --workspace "<work_root>" \
  --model "<resolved_agent_model>" \
  < "$PROMPT_PATH" \
  > "$EVENTS_PATH" \
  2> "$STDERR_PATH"
```

Flag meanings:

- `--mode ask` keeps the consult in read-only/question-answering posture.
- `--output-format stream-json` emits live JSONL and a terminal `result` event.
  Do not add `--verbose`; that flag is Claude-only.
- `--workspace <work_root>` pins the filesystem context.
- `--trust` avoids an interactive trust prompt in known local workspaces.
- Cursor Agent has no documented hook-suppression flag. Do not invent one.

After Cursor Agent exits, read the final `type=result` event from
`events.jsonl` and write its `result` text to `final.txt` before applying the
verdict-footer checks. If no result event exists after a zero exit, treat the
run as malformed and preserve the run directory.

## Monitoring Posture

Consults are not instant. A normal repo-backed consult commonly takes 5+
minutes. Broad artifact reads, `xhigh`, or `max` can reasonably take 20-40
minutes.

Poll on a minutes-scale cadence. Check `events.jsonl`, `stderr.log`, and
process liveness every few minutes; do not poll every few seconds. A missing
`final.txt` before the process exits is not a failure when the event stream is
still alive. Investigate only after the process exits non-zero, the stream
shows an error, or there is no stream activity for a long quiet window.

Do not use Claude `-r`, Cursor Agent `--resume`, `--continue`, `agent resume`,
`agent ls`, or Codex `exec resume`; a consult is a cold read, not a resumed
conversation.

## Failure Behavior

Fail loud and preserve the run directory when:

- the selected CLI is missing
- runtime/model/effort cannot be resolved exactly
- the child exits non-zero
- `final.txt` is empty
- Claude exits without a final `type=result` event
- Cursor Agent exits without a final `type=result` event
- the child omits the required verdict footer

Do not silently fall back between Claude, Codex, and Cursor Agent, one model
to another model, or one effort level to another.
