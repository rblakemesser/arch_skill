# Audit Loop

Use this skill when the job is to inspect a codebase for the next real defect or fragility, fix the best current work, and leave a truthful audit ledger behind.

## When to use

- The user wants a repo-wide audit pass rather than help with one already-known bug.
- The user wants to find and fix real bugs, dead code, duplication, or missing high-value tests in priority order.
- The user wants to run one manual pass now or leave the audit running in Codex until the worthwhile work is exhausted.

## When not to use

- The task is a concrete known bug, crash, regression, or Sentry issue. Use `bugs-flow`.
- The work is fixed-scope feature delivery or architecture planning. Use `arch-step`, `arch-mini-plan`, or `lilarch`.
- The task is an open-ended optimization or investigation loop where the path is unknown and the job is not primarily bug finding. Use `goal-loop` or `north-star-investigation`.

## Non-negotiables

- `_audit_ledger.md` at repo root is the source of truth. Add it to the root `.gitignore` immediately.
- Triage before code changes. Do not skip straight to editing because one suspicious line looks fixable.
- Start with critical paths and existing repo-native evidence. Record unavailable signals as `unknown` instead of auto-installing new tooling.
- Dead code deletion counts as a fix. Duplication on critical paths counts as real bug prevention work.
- Prefer behavior-level verification and integration coverage on critical paths. Do not write negative-value tests.
- Default invocation with no mode is `run`.
- `review` is docs-only.
- `auto` is Codex-only and must fail loud when hook support, `codex_hooks`, or a clean working tree is missing.
- No auto commits. Keep the ledger truthful without relying on git history.

## First move

1. Read `references/ledger-contract.md`.
2. Read `references/shared-doctrine.md`.
3. Resolve the mode:
   - `run`
   - `review`
   - `auto`
4. Resolve repo root, root `.gitignore`, `_audit_ledger.md`, and `.codex/audit-loop-state.json` when in `auto`.
5. Read the matching mode reference and `references/quality-bar.md`.

## Workflow

### 1) `run`

- Create or repair `_audit_ledger.md` and the `.gitignore` entry.
- Refresh triage from critical paths, churn, coverage, dead-code signals, duplication signals, and explicit `SKIP` decisions.
- Pick the highest-priority open area.
- Read the implementation before the tests, log findings, and fix one coherent work package in that area.
- Verify the changes, update the ledger, and stop before drifting into a second area.

### 2) `review`

- Stay docs-only.
- Repair the ledger if it is missing or malformed.
- Re-read the ledger and current repo state from fresh context.
- Set the controller verdict to `CONTINUE`, `CLEAN`, or `BLOCKED` and name the next area or blocker plainly.

### 3) `auto`

- Run Codex-only preflight for hooks, feature flags, and clean worktree state.
- Create or refresh `.codex/audit-loop-state.json`.
- Run one truthful `run` pass.
- Let the installed Stop hook launch a fresh `review` pass and continue only while the verdict stays `CONTINUE`.

## Output expectations

- Update `_audit_ledger.md` in every mode.
- Keep console output short:
  - audit North Star reminder
  - punchline
  - current area or verdict
  - evidence or tests run
  - next action

## Reference map

- `references/ledger-contract.md` - root ledger shape, controller block, status vocabulary, and cleanup lifecycle
- `references/shared-doctrine.md` - prioritization, fix discipline, and anti-patterns
- `references/run.md` - bounded audit/fix pass
- `references/review.md` - fresh docs-only verdict pass
- `references/auto.md` - Codex-only controller contract and state file
- `references/quality-bar.md` - strong vs weak triage, findings, tests, and stop decisions
