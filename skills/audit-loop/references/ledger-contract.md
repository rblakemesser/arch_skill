# Audit Ledger Contract

## Runtime artifacts

- `_audit_ledger.md` lives at repo root.
- The root `.gitignore` must contain `_audit_ledger.md` while the audit is active.
- `.codex/audit-loop-state.<SESSION_ID>.json` exists only while Codex `auto` is armed, with `SESSION_ID` taken from `CODEX_THREAD_ID`.

## Ledger shape

The ledger is the single source of truth for triage, findings, test additions, explicit skips, and automation verdicts.

Keep this top block at the top of the file:

```md
# Audit Ledger
Started: YYYY-MM-DD
Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD

<!-- audit_loop:block:controller:start -->
Verdict: CONTINUE
Next Area:
Stop Reason:
Last Review:
<!-- audit_loop:block:controller:end -->
```

Then keep these sections in order:

```md
## Phase 1: Triage (complete/in-progress)
| # | Area | Risk | Churn | Coverage | Dead Code? | Duplication? | Priority |
|---|------|------|-------|----------|------------|--------------|----------|

## Phase 2: Findings
| # | File:Line | Type | Description | Fix | Status |
|---|-----------|------|-------------|-----|--------|

## Phase 3: Test Additions
| # | Test File | Covers | Type | Why It Matters |
|---|-----------|--------|------|----------------|

## Decisions Log
```

## Controller block rules

- Do not rename or remove the controller markers once the ledger is live.
- `Verdict` values are exactly:
  - `CONTINUE`
  - `CLEAN`
  - `BLOCKED`
- `Next Area` is required for `CONTINUE`.
- `Next Area` may name a broader risk front or problem cluster that spans multiple files or surfaces.
- `Stop Reason` is required for `BLOCKED`.
- `Last Review` is written by `review` in `YYYY-MM-DD` form.
- `review` owns the authoritative controller verdict used by `auto`.

## Findings vocabulary

- `Type` values:
  - `BUG`
  - `DEAD`
  - `DUP`
  - `GAP`
  - `SMELL`
- `Status` values:
  - `OPEN`
  - `IN PROGRESS`
  - `FIXED (working tree)`
  - `FIXED (verified)`
  - `SKIP`
  - `BLOCKED`

## Priority matrix

- `P0` = critical path + (`low coverage` or `high churn` or `duplication`)
- `P1` = critical path + adequately tested but still has dead code or duplication worth fixing
- `P2` = non-critical but high-churn with low coverage or repeated fragility
- `P3` = everything else
- `SKIP` = low risk, low churn, already tested enough, or explicitly not worth investing in now

Every `SKIP` needs a reason in `## Decisions Log`.

## Tool-signal rules

- Use existing repo-native coverage, dead-code, and duplication tooling first.
- If a signal is unavailable, record `unknown` in triage and explain it in `## Decisions Log`.
- Do not auto-install new tools just to satisfy the ledger.

## Cleanup lifecycle

- When the workflow starts, ensure `_audit_ledger.md` exists and `.gitignore` contains `_audit_ledger.md`.
- Manual `run` leaves the ledger in place.
- `review` leaves the ledger in place.
- `auto` deletes `_audit_ledger.md` only when the final verdict is `CLEAN`.
- On clean cleanup, remove the `_audit_ledger.md` line from `.gitignore`.
- If the skill created `.gitignore` and it becomes empty after cleanup, delete `.gitignore`.
