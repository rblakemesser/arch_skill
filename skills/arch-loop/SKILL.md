# Arch Loop

Hook-backed loop that keeps the parent agent working against the user's literal requirements until a fresh external Codex `gpt-5.4` `xhigh` auditor says the loop may stop.

## When to use

- The user names a stop contract in prose: "implement this and do not stop until `$agent-linter` is clean", "keep checking this host every 30 minutes for the next 6 hours", "iterate up to 5 times until tests pass".
- The user wants real hook-backed continuation in Codex or Claude Code, not prompt-only repetition.
- The user wants the termination decision from a fresh external auditor, not the parent agent's self-assessment.
- The user wants a named skill audit (such as `$agent-linter` or `$audit`) bound into the stop condition.

## When not to use

- The user wants the canonical full-arch flow with a plan doc. Use `arch-step` (`implement-loop` / `auto-implement`).
- The user wants a repo-wide audit pass with a root ledger. Use `audit-loop`, `audit-loop-sim`, or `comment-loop`.
- The user wants the docs-only suite continuation. Use `arch-docs auto`.
- The request is pure "wait until this external condition is true, then continue once". Use `delay-poll`.
- The runtime is neither Codex nor Claude Code, or the installed Stop hook is unavailable.
- The work fits in one turn and does not actually need an external auditor.
- The user wants a background daemon or remote scheduling that survives the session.

## Non-negotiables

- **Real hook-backed behavior.** The installed runner is `~/.agents/skills/arch-step/scripts/arch_controller_stop_hook.py`. Codex wires it via `~/.codex/hooks.json` with `--runtime codex`; Claude Code wires it via `~/.claude/settings.json` with `--runtime claude`. If the runner or the repo-managed `Stop` entry for the active runtime is missing, fail loud.
- **Fresh external verdict.** Termination comes from a Codex `gpt-5.4` `xhigh` child launched by the hook. The parent never self-certifies completion.
- **`raw_requirements` is pinned.** Capture the user's full request literally and never edit it across turns. The runner stores `sha256(raw_requirements)` as `raw_requirements_hash` at arm time and recomputes it on every read; mismatch clears state with `raw_requirements mutation detected`.
- **Audit status is evaluator-owned.** After the initial `pending` seed at arm, parent passes may update `latest_summary` and `evidence_path` but must not touch `required_skill_audits[].status`. The runner pins `(skill, target, requirement, status)` as `audits_authoritative_fingerprint`; any parent-side edit to those four fields clears state with `audit status mutation detected`.
- **Allowed status vocabulary is `pending`, `pass`, `fail`, `missing`, `inapplicable`.** Use `pending` while proof is in progress; put narrative words like `completed` or `fixing_in_progress` in `latest_summary`.
- **Deterministic cap parsing.** Only unambiguous runtime/iteration/cadence phrases parse into machine constraints; ambiguous text fails loud before the loop arms (see `references/cap-extraction.md`).
- **One controller per session.** `arch-loop` shares the duplicate-controller registry, so any other armed controller state for the same session is a conflict.
- **Do not run the Stop hook yourself.** After arming, end the turn naturally and let the hook own continuation.
- **No separate runner.** `arch-loop` is owned by the shared suite hook; do not fork a dedicated controller binary.
- **Child-requested yield is the only graceful pause lever.** When a parent work pass has nothing useful to do right now (waiting on a long async job), it may write a single `requested_yield` object into state before ending the turn. The Stop hook honors and clears it. `requested_yield` does not replace the evaluator-driven `continue_mode=wait_recheck` cadence path; cadence is still the right tool when the user pre-armed an interval. When `last_next_task` is shaped like *"Let the active X finish, then …"* or *"Wait for X to complete, then …"*, the parent pass is one `requested_yield: {kind: "sleep_for", seconds: N, ...}` write — not a short `date` / `ls` / `tail` poll followed by a natural turn-end, because every natural turn-end pays a fresh Codex `gpt-5.4` `xhigh` evaluator pass. See `skills/_shared/controller-contract.md` §Choosing the yield kind for the canonical "detached job → `sleep_for`" rule, and `references/examples.md` Example 5 for the worked shape.
- **No-progress rule.** After two consecutive parent passes with no real change (no repo file edit, no plan/doc edit, no new evidence the audit/evaluator has not seen), end with `requested_yield: {kind: "await_user", reason: "no progress after 2 passes: ..."}` instead of firing another identical pass. See `skills/_shared/controller-contract.md` §Parent-pass discipline.
- **No invented budgets.** The hook owns timing (`deadline_at`, iteration cap, parsed cadence). Do not self-declare `blocked` or "outside in-session budget" because remaining work feels expensive or the auditor is costly. Take the next reachable step, arm `requested_yield: sleep_for` for a paced pause, or yield `await_user` if the armed window is genuinely too small. Terminal verdicts come from the controller, not from invented budgets.
- **Exhaust the frontier before handing to audit.** Ending the turn is not a cheap checkpoint — each turn end pays for a full fresh audit or evaluator child run. End the turn when you believe you are done with everything reachable (full plan frontier, every reachable phase, every named audit), not after one local fix. If a blocker stops you short, yield explicitly via `await_user` or `sleep_for`; do not drop the turn silently mid-frontier.
- **Respect the tree state the user gave you.** Do not stash changes, create new branches, split the work across multiple PRs, or rewrite history. Commit hygiene, branch strategy, and PR shape are the user's decisions.
- **Parallel-agent edits are a pause signal, not a revert signal.** If the working tree contains edits this pass did not make (foreign file, unexpected compiler error, unfamiliar commit), pause via `requested_yield: {kind: "sleep_for", seconds: 300, ...}` to let the other agent land its fix. Do not revert. Escalate via `await_user` only after two pause-retry cycles fail.

## First move

Read these in order before writing state:

1. `references/controller-contract.md` — state schema (including `raw_requirements_hash` and `audits_authoritative_fingerprint`), runtime state paths, lifecycle, continuation outcomes, writes matrix, and named-audit evidence shape.
2. `references/cap-extraction.md` — duration/window, cadence, and iteration phrase families; ambiguity handling; strictest-cap selection; hook-timeout fit.
3. `references/evaluator-prompt.md` — the fresh Codex evaluator's contract and its structured JSON output shape.

Then resolve the active host runtime, run `arch_controller_stop_hook.py --ensure-installed --runtime <codex|claude>` (it fails loud if the canonical Stop entry cannot be written), and only once that succeeds capture `raw_requirements` verbatim and parse the unambiguous caps.

## Workflow

**Arm first, disarm never.** This skill is hook-owned. The first step of every invocation writes a session-scoped controller state file; the last step of the parent turn is to end the turn. Parent turns do not run the Stop hook, do not delete state, and do not clean up early — the Stop hook is the only process that clears state, and only on a fresh evaluator verdict (`clean` / `blocked`), a deadline, the iteration cap, or a controller failure.

### 1) Initial invocation

1. **Arm.** Ensure-install the Stop hook (`arch_controller_stop_hook.py --ensure-installed --runtime <codex|claude>`; fails loud on any drift) → resolve the session id (on Claude Code via `arch_controller_stop_hook.py --current-session`; abort with the tool's error if it fails) → capture `raw_requirements` literally → run the deterministic cap/cadence parser → detect named audits → seed `required_skill_audits` with `status: pending` → compute `raw_requirements_hash = sha256(raw_requirements)` and write the session-scoped state file at version 2 before any work pass starts → do one bounded work pass (or one immediate grounded check when cadence-only) → refresh named audits' `latest_summary` / `evidence_path` only (do not touch `status`) → update `last_work_summary` and `last_verification_summary` → end the turn.
2. **Body** (hook-owned). The hook validates hash + fingerprint, enforces `deadline_at` and cadence fit, launches the fresh Codex evaluator, copies each audit's `status` + evidence pointer out of the evaluator JSON into state, recomputes the fingerprint, and dispatches the verdict.
3. **Disarm** (hook-owned). On `clean` or `blocked`, the hook clears state. Deadline, iteration cap, and controller failures also clear state.

### 2) Continuation invocation by the parent

- Read the armed state file. Do not ask the user to restate `raw_requirements`.
- Treat `last_next_task` as guidance, not a replacement for `raw_requirements`.
- Do one bounded work pass, refresh named-audit `latest_summary` / `evidence_path`, and end the turn. Never edit `raw_requirements`, `required_skill_audits[].status`, or the two hash fields — the runner clears state on any such mutation.
- If `last_continue_mode` was `wait_recheck`, do not act as the parent until the hook switches back to `parent_work` or the loop stops.

## Output expectations

- Initial invocation:
  - one-line North Star reminder of the captured requirement
  - punchline: armed or already clean
  - parsed caps and cadence with their source phrase
  - named audits detected
  - exact next move (typically: end the turn and let the Stop hook run)
- Continuation invocation:
  - one-line reminder of `raw_requirements`
  - what the last evaluator said and what the next bounded pass will do
  - end naturally

## Reference map

- `references/controller-contract.md` — state schema, writes matrix (including the hook-owned audit-status fingerprint), runtime state paths, lifecycle, continuation outcomes, timeout/max-iteration handling, and named-audit evidence.
- `references/cap-extraction.md` — duration/window, cadence, and iteration phrase families, ambiguity handling, strictest-cap selection, hook-timeout fit.
- `references/evaluator-prompt.md` — the canonical prompt contract for the fresh Codex `gpt-5.4` `xhigh` external evaluator, including the structured JSON output shape with `satisfied_requirements[].evidence` and `required_skill_audits[].status`.
- `references/examples.md` — canonical asks, a drift-catching example where the evaluator reverses a parent-claimed `pass`, and anti-cases.
