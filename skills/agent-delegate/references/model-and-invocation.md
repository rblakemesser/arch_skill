# Model And Invocation

Use this reference to resolve what the user meant by "Claude", "Codex",
"opus high", "gpt 5.5 xhigh", or similar phrasing, and to run the selected
worker subprocess or explicit parallel group of worker subprocesses. Fresh
one-shot is the default. Same-session resume is allowed only when the caller
explicitly requires continuity for one worker.

## Required Values

Every delegation child needs:

- `mode` - `fresh-one-shot`, `fresh-resumable`, or `resume`
- `runtime` - `claude` or `codex`
- `model` - the runnable CLI model identifier, or the previous session model
  when a resume intentionally reuses it
- `effort` - the reasoning effort level, or the previous session effort when a
  resume intentionally reuses it

Resume mode also needs either:

- `session_id` - Claude `session_id` or Codex `thread_id`
- `run_dir` - a previous `agent-delegate` run directory containing
  `session_id.txt` and `execution.json`

If any value is missing or ambiguous, ask one consolidated question before
invoking:

```text
I need the delegate runtime, model, effort, and resume handle before invoking
an external agent. The delegate runs as a foreground subprocess, can edit the
shared worktree, and can spend real model budget. What should I use?
```

Add only the missing facts to the question when some values are already known.

Parallel groups use the same required values for each child. Default to one
shared runtime/model/effort for all children. If the user clearly assigns
different execution choices to different children, apply those choices exactly
and announce the mapping before launch.

## Delegation Mode

- `fresh-one-shot` is the default. It creates a cold child and may use stateless
  CLI flags.
- `fresh-resumable` creates a cold child that can be resumed later. Use it only
  when the caller says this worker may need same-session continuation.
- `resume` continues an explicit same-runtime session id or prior run
  directory. Do not resume "latest" sessions, do not use Claude `--continue`,
  and do not use Codex `--last`.

Same-runtime is mandatory. Claude sessions resume through Claude with
`-r <session_id>`. Codex threads resume through `codex exec resume
<thread_id>`.

Parallel delegation supports `fresh-one-shot` and `fresh-resumable`. Keep
`resume` on the single-worker path; launching several resumed sessions at once
is a different orchestration problem and is not part of this prompt-first
skill.

## Runtime Inference

Infer runtime only when the user's wording makes it unambiguous:

- `codex`, `gpt`, `gpt-5.5`, `gpt 5.5 high`, or `gpt-5.3-codex` implies
  `runtime=codex`.
- `claude`, `opus`, `sonnet`, or `haiku` implies `runtime=claude`.
- If the user names only an effort level, such as "xhigh", ask for runtime and
  model.
- If the user says only "delegate this" or "have another agent do this", ask
  for runtime, model, and effort.

Do not choose a favorite default. The selected model changes both cost and
quality, so the user supplies it.

## Model Phrase Resolution

Treat model text as intent, not a loose alias:

- Preserve model family and numeric version exactly. `gpt 5.5` may normalize to
  `gpt-5.5`; it must not become `gpt-5.4`. `opus 4.7` may normalize to
  `claude-opus-4-7`; it must not become another Opus version.
- If the user says `gpt 5.4` or a `gpt-5.4` variant while choosing a model,
  pause before execution and ask whether they meant `gpt-5.5` or explicitly
  want `gpt-5.4`. This is an intent check, not an alias rule: do not rewrite
  the version yourself.
- For Codex, inspect `codex debug models` when needed and choose an available
  identifier with the same family and exact version. If no exact match exists
  or multiple matches are plausible, ask for the runnable model id.
- For Claude, when the runtime is Claude and the user names family plus
  version, prefer `claude-<family>-<version-with-hyphens>`, for example
  `claude-opus-4-7` or `claude-sonnet-4-6`.
- Family-only Claude aliases such as `opus`, `sonnet`, or `haiku` are allowed
  only when the user did not pin a version.
- Do not run paid trial prompts to discover whether a Claude model exists. Use
  the CLI help/config surface when available; otherwise ask.

Always announce the raw-to-resolved mapping before execution:

```text
Claude Opus 4.7 xhigh -> runtime=claude, model=claude-opus-4-7, effort=xhigh
```

For deterministic script plumbing that needs the same rules, use
`skills/_shared/model_resolution.py` instead of creating a local model alias
table. The helper exists to keep fresh-consult, agent-delegate,
Stepwise-style orchestrators, and arch-epic automatic harnesses aligned on
exact-version preservation and fail-loud behavior.

## Effort Resolution

- Claude accepts `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max` via `--effort`.
- Codex effort is passed as `-c model_reasoning_effort='"<level>"'`.
- For Codex, confirm the selected model supports the requested effort when
  `codex debug models` is needed for model resolution.
- If the effort is missing or the selected model does not support it, ask.
- A caller rule like "copywriting always xhigh" is execution intent from the
  caller. Apply it only to the delegated turn it clearly controls; do not add a
  built-in task taxonomy inside this skill.

## Run Directory

Create one run directory per delegation child:

```bash
DELEGATE_SLUG="<short-slug>"
RUN_TS="$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)"
RUN_DIR="$(mktemp -d "/tmp/agent-delegate/${DELEGATE_SLUG}-${RUN_TS}-XXXXXX")"
PROMPT_PATH="$RUN_DIR/prompt.md"
FINAL_PATH="$RUN_DIR/final.txt"
EVENTS_PATH="$RUN_DIR/events.jsonl"
STDERR_PATH="$RUN_DIR/stderr.log"
EXECUTION_PATH="$RUN_DIR/execution.json"
SESSION_PATH="$RUN_DIR/session_id.txt"
RESUME_FROM_PATH="$RUN_DIR/resume_from.txt"
```

Write the prompt to `prompt.md`. Do not pass a long multiline prompt directly
on the command line.

`events.jsonl` is the live child stream. `stderr.log` is the diagnostic error
stream. `final.txt` is the final assistant text: Codex writes it directly with
`-o`; for Claude, copy the `result` text from the final `type=result` event
after the process exits.

Write `execution.json` before invocation with at least:

```json
{
  "mode": "fresh-one-shot | fresh-resumable | resume",
  "runtime": "claude | codex",
  "model": "<resolved model or reused-from-session>",
  "effort": "<resolved effort or reused-from-session>",
  "work_root": "<absolute path>",
  "forced_execution_on_resume": false
}
```

For fresh-resumable and resume runs, write the captured or reused session id to
`session_id.txt`. For resume runs, write the source run directory or explicit
session id to `resume_from.txt`.

## Parallel Delegation Group

Use the parallel group path only when the user asks for parallel agents or gives
multiple delegated tasks for this skill. Parallel workers are still ordinary
delegate children; the group only gives the parent a place to organize prompts,
streams, finals, execution metadata, and the combined report.

Create one group directory:

```bash
GROUP_SLUG="<short-slug>"
RUN_TS="$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)"
GROUP_DIR="$(mktemp -d "/tmp/agent-delegate/parallel-${GROUP_SLUG}-${RUN_TS}-XXXXXX")"
```

For each child, create an ordinary child run directory beneath the group:

```bash
CHILD_SLUG="<child-slug>"
RUN_DIR="$GROUP_DIR/$CHILD_SLUG"
mkdir -p "$RUN_DIR"
PROMPT_PATH="$RUN_DIR/prompt.md"
FINAL_PATH="$RUN_DIR/final.txt"
EVENTS_PATH="$RUN_DIR/events.jsonl"
STDERR_PATH="$RUN_DIR/stderr.log"
EXECUTION_PATH="$RUN_DIR/execution.json"
SESSION_PATH="$RUN_DIR/session_id.txt"
```

Write `execution.json` before each child invocation with the normal fields plus:

```json
{
  "parallel_group_dir": "<absolute group dir>",
  "child_id": "<stable child id>",
  "child_task": "<one-line task>",
  "allowed_write_scope": "<scope from the prompt>"
}
```

Launch each child with the same Codex or Claude command shape below, using that
child's paths. Record the shell PID and exit status in the child directory if
the host shell makes that convenient, but do not introduce a script, controller,
detached monitor, separate worktree, or merge layer.

Do not block launch because siblings might touch nearby files. Brief every
child that other workers may be editing the same repo, that unfamiliar changes
must not be reverted, and that actual conflicts should be reported with file
evidence. After all children finish, inspect repo state and child reports before
presenting the combined result.

Wait for all children before reporting. If one child fails or returns malformed
output, preserve its run directory and include that failure in the group report;
do not discard successful sibling work.

## Codex Fresh One-Shot

Use this shape for a default stateless Codex delegation:

```bash
codex exec \
  --ephemeral \
  --disable codex_hooks \
  -C "<work_root>" \
  --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox \
  --skip-git-repo-check \
  --model "<resolved_model>" \
  -c model_reasoning_effort='"<resolved_effort>"' \
  --json \
  -o "$FINAL_PATH" \
  < "$PROMPT_PATH" \
  > "$EVENTS_PATH" \
  2> "$STDERR_PATH"
```

`--ephemeral` keeps the child stateless and cold. Use this only for
`fresh-one-shot`; ephemeral sessions are not resumable.

## Codex Fresh Resumable

Use this shape when a Codex worker may need later same-session resume:

```bash
codex exec \
  --disable codex_hooks \
  -C "<work_root>" \
  --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox \
  --skip-git-repo-check \
  --model "<resolved_model>" \
  -c model_reasoning_effort='"<resolved_effort>"' \
  --json \
  -o "$FINAL_PATH" \
  < "$PROMPT_PATH" \
  > "$EVENTS_PATH" \
  2> "$STDERR_PATH"
```

Capture the `thread_id` from the first `thread.started` event in
`events.jsonl` and write it to `session_id.txt`. If no thread id is captured,
write `UNRECOVERABLE` to `session_id.txt`, treat the run as malformed, and
preserve the run directory.

## Codex Resume

Use this shape to resume an explicit Codex thread:

```bash
codex exec resume "<thread_id>" \
  --disable codex_hooks \
  --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox \
  --skip-git-repo-check \
  --json \
  -o "$FINAL_PATH" \
  < "$PROMPT_PATH" \
  > "$EVENTS_PATH" \
  2> "$STDERR_PATH"
```

`codex exec resume` carries the working directory from the original session.
Do not pass `-C` / `--cd` on resume.

Omit `--model` and effort config to reuse the session's execution choice. If
the caller explicitly requires a model or effort change on resume, announce
that mapping and add both flags:

```bash
  --model "<resolved_model>" \
  -c model_reasoning_effort='"<resolved_effort>"' \
```

Do not use `--last`; resume must name the exact `thread_id`.

## Claude Fresh

Use this shape for both `fresh-one-shot` and `fresh-resumable` Claude
delegations:

```bash
claude -p \
  --output-format stream-json \
  --verbose \
  --include-partial-messages \
  --include-hook-events \
  --dangerously-skip-permissions \
  --settings '{"disableAllHooks":true}' \
  --model "<resolved_model>" \
  --effort "<resolved_effort>" \
  < "$PROMPT_PATH" \
  > "$EVENTS_PATH" \
  2> "$STDERR_PATH"
```

Run Claude from `work_root`. Do not pass `--no-session-persistence` for
fresh-resumable runs.

After Claude exits, read the final `type=result` event from `events.jsonl` and
write its `result` text to `final.txt` before applying the status-footer
checks. For fresh-resumable runs, also write the final result event's
`session_id` to `session_id.txt`. If no result event exists after a zero exit,
or a fresh-resumable run has no session id, treat the run as malformed and
preserve the run directory.

`--verbose` is required by the Claude CLI when `--output-format stream-json` is
used. Do not omit it from fresh or resumed Claude delegation commands.

## Claude Resume

Use this shape to resume an explicit Claude session:

```bash
claude -p \
  --output-format stream-json \
  --verbose \
  --include-partial-messages \
  --include-hook-events \
  --dangerously-skip-permissions \
  --settings '{"disableAllHooks":true}' \
  --model "<resolved_model>" \
  --effort "<resolved_effort>" \
  -r "<session_id>" \
  < "$PROMPT_PATH" \
  > "$EVENTS_PATH" \
  2> "$STDERR_PATH"
```

Run the resume from the same `work_root` used by the original Claude session.
Use `-r <session_id>`, never `--continue`, because `--continue` chooses the
most recent conversation in the current directory and can collide with other
work.

After Claude exits, write the final `result` text to `final.txt`. Write the
returned `session_id` to `session_id.txt` when present; otherwise preserve the
input session id in `session_id.txt`.

## Monitoring Posture

Delegated work is not instant. A normal repo-backed task commonly takes 5+
minutes. Broad edits, verification, `xhigh`, or `max` can reasonably take
20-40 minutes.

Poll on a minutes-scale cadence. Check `events.jsonl`, `stderr.log`, repo
state if writes are expected, and process liveness every few minutes; do not
poll every few seconds. A missing `final.txt` before the process exits is not a
failure when the event stream is still alive. Investigate only after the
process exits non-zero, the stream shows an error, or there is no stream
activity for a long quiet window.

## Failure Behavior

Fail loud and preserve the run directory when:

- the selected CLI is missing
- runtime/model/effort cannot be resolved exactly
- the allowed write scope is missing or unsafe
- resume mode has no explicit session id or prior run directory
- `session_id.txt` is missing, empty, or `UNRECOVERABLE` for a resume
- the caller asks for cross-runtime resume
- the caller asks for Claude `--continue`, Codex `--last`, or "latest" resume
  selection
- the child exits non-zero
- `final.txt` is empty
- Claude exits without a final `type=result` event
- fresh-resumable Codex does not emit `thread.started`
- the child omits the required status footer

Do not silently fall back from Claude to Codex, Codex to Claude, one model to
another model, one effort level to another, foreground to detached execution,
or shared-worktree execution to a separate worktree.
