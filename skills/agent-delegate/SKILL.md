# Agent Delegate

Use this skill when the user wants one or more Claude Opus, Codex GPT/GBT,
Cursor Composer, or Grok subprocesses to do concrete tasks with normal local agent
capabilities. Fresh one-shot delegation is the default: each child starts from
disk and the delegation prompt, not from the current chat history. When the
caller explicitly requires continuity for one worker, resume the same runtime's
previously delegated worker session with a new, bounded prompt.

The child may read files, edit files, run commands, verify its work, and use
installed skills when they fit the task.

This is a prompt-engineering skill. It ships no scripts, shims, hook
controllers, state machines, parsers, detached monitors, or install-time
automation.

## When to use

- "Have another agent implement this while we keep the main thread clean."
- "Run two parallel agents on these fixes."
- "Delegate this refactor to Claude and report back."
- "Use Codex to fix the docs drift and run the checks."
- "Use Cursor Agent Composer to implement this slice and report back."
- "Use Grok Build to investigate and patch this workflow."
- "Spin up a fresh agent to investigate and repair this failing test."
- "Have a child agent use `$skill-authoring` to patch this skill package."
- "Resume the same delegated Claude session and continue with higher effort."
- Another skill needs a foreground operational worker turn, not just an
  independent read.

## When not to use

- The user wants a clean read, second opinion, consistency check, completion
  audit, or readability/confusion check with no file edits. Use
  `$fresh-consult`.
- The user wants deterministic code-review coverage with lens fan-out,
  artifacts, and enforced Codex review policy. Use `$code-review`.
- The user specifically asks for the existing Codex `-p yolo` review pattern.
  Use `$codex-review-yolo`.
- The user wants two models to iterate on a plan, architecture, design, or
  concept until they converge. Use `$model-consensus`.
- The work is an ordered subprocess workflow with manifests, critics, repair
  loops, or persistent orchestration. Use `$stepwise` or `$arch-epic`.
- The task needs a detached/background worker, a separate git worktree, or
  merge machinery. This skill is foreground and shared-worktree only.
- There is no concrete task, work root, success bar, or write scope for the
  child being launched.
- The requested runtime CLI is not installed.
- The caller wants to resume "the latest" child without an explicit session id
  or prior run directory and ambiguity cannot be resolved safely.

## Non-Negotiables

- Resolve each delegated task, success bar, work root, allowed write scope,
  constraints, delegation mode, and exact user-named inputs before launching
  child processes.
- Runtime, model, and effort must be known. Codex runs GPT/GBT/OpenAI models,
  Claude Code runs Opus, Cursor Agent runs `composer-2.5-fast`, and Grok CLI
  runs `grok-build` or `grok-composer-2.5-fast`. If any value is missing or
  ambiguous, ask one consolidated question before invoking.
- Never run GPT/GBT or Claude models through Cursor Agent or Grok. Do not pass
  Grok model ids to Codex, Claude, or Cursor Agent.
- Delegation mode is one of `fresh-one-shot`, `fresh-resumable`, or `resume`.
  Default to `fresh-one-shot`. Use `fresh-resumable` or `resume` only when the
  caller explicitly requires same-session continuity.
- Resume mode requires an explicit session id or a previous run directory with
  `session_id.txt`. Refuse missing, empty, `UNRECOVERABLE`, cross-runtime, or
  "latest session" resume requests.
- Treat model text as intent, not a fuzzy alias. Preserve exact family and
  numeric version; never silently substitute a nearby model.
- Run the child hook-suppressed where the runtime supports it, unsandboxed, and
  in the shared worktree per this repo's convention. Prompt boundaries define
  the task; the sandbox does not.
- Fresh one-shot runs may be stateless. Fresh-resumable runs must capture a
  session handle. Resume runs must use the same runtime as the captured handle:
  Claude resumes through Claude, Codex resumes through Codex, Cursor Agent
  resumes through Cursor Agent, and Grok resumes through Grok.
- For a single delegation, create one namespaced run directory under
  `/tmp/agent-delegate/` and keep `prompt.md`, `final.txt`, `events.jsonl`,
  `stderr.log`, and `execution.json` there. For fresh-resumable and resume
  runs, also keep `session_id.txt`; for resume runs, also keep
  `resume_from.txt`.
- For explicit parallel delegations, create one group directory under
  `/tmp/agent-delegate/` and one ordinary child run directory per worker. Do
  not add a controller, detached monitor, separate worktree, or merge layer.
- Brief the child like a capable colleague walking in cold: include the task,
  success criteria, work root, allowed write scope, constraints, exact
  user-named inputs, the parallelism instruction, and report contract. For
  resume prompts, state the new instruction or evidence and what remains
  unchanged from the original delegation.
- Tell the child to read local instructions such as `AGENTS.md` before editing
  covered files.
- In parallel groups, tell each child it is not alone in the codebase, must not
  revert unfamiliar changes, should make the smallest task-relevant edits, and
  should report actual conflicts if they happen.
- Do not paste secrets into prompts. If a token is needed, source it into the
  child environment and tell the child which environment variable to read.
- Do not ask the child to commit, push, open PRs, rewrite history, stash, or
  revert unrelated work unless the delegated task explicitly requires that
  exact operation.
- Do not use external continuation controllers as a strategy. This skill is
  a foreground subprocess path, not an ordered workflow runner.
- If the child changed files or reports a blocker, inspect the repo state before
  presenting the result as fact.

## First Move

1. Read `references/model-and-invocation.md`.
2. Read `references/delegate-prompt-and-output.md`.
3. Identify the delegated task or parallel delegated tasks, success bar, work
   root, exact user-named inputs, allowed write scope, constraints, and
   requested runtime/model/effort from the user's words.
4. Identify the delegation mode. Use `fresh-one-shot` unless the caller
   explicitly asks for a resumable worker or to resume a previous delegate.
5. If runtime/model/effort, write scope, or a required resume handle is
   incomplete, ask one question that names exactly what is missing and what it
   controls.
6. Confirm the selected CLI exists with `command -v codex`, `command -v
   claude`, `command -v agent`, or `command -v grok`.
7. Create the run directory or group directory and write each delegation prompt
   to its own `prompt.md`.
8. Invoke each child with the exact command shape from the invocation reference.

## Workflow

1. **Shape the delegation.** State the concrete work, allowed write scope,
   success bar, constraints, and exact user-named inputs such as paths, failing
   commands, repro steps, or docs.
2. **Resolve execution.** Map the raw model phrase to
   `runtime=<claude|codex|agent|grok>`, `model=<runnable id>`, and
   `effort=<level-or-encoded-in-model>`.
   Announce the mapping before execution.
3. **Select single or parallel.** Use one child by default. Use a parallel group
   only when the user asks for parallel workers or gives multiple delegated
   tasks.
4. **Select continuity.** Use `fresh-one-shot` by default. Use
   `fresh-resumable` when the caller says this worker may need later resume.
   Use `resume` only with an explicit same-runtime session id or prior run
   directory. Keep resume on the single-worker path.
5. **Run the child or children.** Use disabled hooks, no sandbox, a shared
   worktree, namespaced run directories, and live event capture. Fresh one-shot
   runs start cold; fresh-resumable runs start persistent child sessions; resume
   runs continue the captured session.
6. **Monitor patiently.** Normal delegated work often takes 5+ minutes; broad
   repo edits, verification, `xhigh`, or `max` can reasonably take 20-40
   minutes. Poll live `events.jsonl` and `stderr.log` every few minutes, not
   every few seconds.
7. **Consume the result.** Read `final.txt`, locate the status footer, and
   inspect `events.jsonl`/`stderr.log` when the final output is missing or
   malformed. For fresh-resumable and resume runs, preserve the session handle
   for the next explicit resume.
8. **Inspect local truth.** Check git status and any changed files named by the
   child or children before reporting upstream.
9. **Report upstream.** For one child, lead with status, changed files,
   verification, blockers, confidence limits, and the run directory. For a
   parallel group, report one compact child-by-child table plus the parent repo
   state check and combined outcome.

## Output Expectations

- A concise parent-facing report:
  - delegation mode
  - runtime/model/effort used
  - delegated task status, or one status per child for parallel groups
  - changed files or `none`
  - skills the child says it used or `none`
  - verification run or `not run: <reason>`
  - blockers or `none`
  - follow-up needed or `none`
  - run directory path, or group directory plus child run directories
  - session id or `none` when not resumable
- If the child output is missing or malformed, say that plainly and preserve the
  run directory for debugging. Do not invent a status.
- If the child is wrong about a changed file, blocker, or verification result,
  say so explicitly and cite the evidence that contradicts it.
