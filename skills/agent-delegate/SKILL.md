# Agent Delegate

Use this skill when the user wants a fresh Claude or Codex subprocess to do a
concrete task with normal local agent capabilities. The child starts from disk
and the delegation prompt, not from the current chat history, and may read
files, edit files, run commands, verify its work, and use installed skills when
they fit the task.

This is a prompt-engineering skill. It ships no scripts, shims, hook
controllers, state machines, parsers, detached monitors, or install-time
automation.

## When to use

- "Have another agent implement this while we keep the main thread clean."
- "Delegate this refactor to Claude and report back."
- "Use Codex to fix the docs drift and run the checks."
- "Spin up a fresh agent to investigate and repair this failing test."
- "Have a child agent use `$skill-authoring` to patch this skill package."
- Another skill needs a one-shot operational worker, not just an independent
  read.

## When not to use

- The user wants a clean read, second opinion, consistency check, completion
  audit, or readability/confusion check with no file edits. Use
  `$fresh-consult`.
- The user wants deterministic code-review coverage with lens fan-out,
  artifacts, and enforced Codex review policy. Use `$code-review`.
- The user specifically asks for the existing Codex `-p yolo` review pattern.
  Use `$codex-review-yolo`.
- The user wants two models to iterate on a plan, architecture, design, or
  concept until they converge. Use `$model-consensus`.
- The work is an ordered subprocess workflow with manifests, critics, repair
  loops, or persistent orchestration. Use `$stepwise` or `$arch-epic`.
- The task needs a detached/background worker, a separate git worktree, or
  merge machinery. This v1 is foreground and shared-worktree only.
- There is no concrete task, work root, success bar, or write scope.
- The requested runtime CLI is not installed.

## Non-Negotiables

- Resolve one delegated task, the success bar, the authoritative artifacts, the
  work root, and the allowed write scope before launching a child process.
- Runtime, model, and effort must be known. If any are missing or ambiguous,
  ask one consolidated question before invoking.
- Treat model text as intent, not a fuzzy alias. Preserve exact family and
  numeric version; never silently substitute a nearby model.
- Run the child fresh, hook-suppressed, unsandboxed, and in the shared worktree
  per this repo's convention. Prompt boundaries define the task; the sandbox
  does not.
- Create one namespaced run directory under `/tmp/agent-delegate/` and keep
  `prompt.md`, `final.txt`, and `stream.log` there.
- Brief the child like a capable colleague walking in cold: include the task,
  paths, success criteria, constraints, allowed write scope, and report
  contract.
- Tell the child to read local instructions such as `AGENTS.md` before editing
  covered files.
- Do not paste secrets into prompts. If a token is needed, source it into the
  child environment and tell the child which environment variable to read.
- Do not ask the child to commit, push, open PRs, rewrite history, stash, or
  revert unrelated work unless the delegated task explicitly requires that
  exact operation.
- Do not use hook-backed controllers as a continuation strategy. This skill is
  a one-shot foreground subprocess.
- If the child changed files or reports a blocker, inspect the repo state before
  presenting the result as fact.

## First Move

1. Read `references/model-and-invocation.md`.
2. Read `references/delegate-prompt-and-output.md`.
3. Identify the delegated task, success bar, work root, authoritative
   artifacts, allowed write scope, constraints, and requested
   runtime/model/effort from the user's words.
4. If runtime/model/effort or write scope is incomplete, ask one question that
   names exactly what is missing and what it controls.
5. Confirm the selected CLI exists with `command -v codex` or
   `command -v claude`.
6. Create the run directory and write the delegation prompt to `prompt.md`.
7. Invoke the child with the exact command shape from the invocation reference.

## Workflow

1. **Shape the delegation.** State the concrete work, allowed write scope,
   success bar, constraints, and authoritative files, commits, docs, or claims.
2. **Resolve execution.** Map the raw model phrase to
   `runtime=<claude|codex>`, `model=<runnable id>`, and `effort=<level>`.
   Announce the mapping before execution.
3. **Run the child.** Use a fresh subprocess, no inherited session, disabled
   hooks, no sandbox, a shared worktree, and a namespaced run directory.
4. **Consume the result.** Read `final.txt`, locate the status footer, and
   inspect `stream.log` only when the final output is missing or malformed.
5. **Inspect local truth.** Check git status and any changed files named by the
   child before reporting upstream.
6. **Report upstream.** Lead with status, changed files, verification, blockers,
   confidence limits, and the run directory.

## Output Expectations

- A concise parent-facing report:
  - runtime/model/effort used
  - delegated task status
  - changed files or `none`
  - skills the child says it used or `none`
  - verification run or `not run: <reason>`
  - blockers or `none`
  - follow-up needed or `none`
  - run directory path
- If the child output is missing or malformed, say that plainly and preserve the
  run directory for debugging. Do not invent a status.
- If the child is wrong about a changed file, blocker, or verification result,
  say so explicitly and cite the evidence that contradicts it.

## Reference Map

- `references/model-and-invocation.md` - runtime/model/effort resolution and
  exact Claude/Codex command shapes
- `references/delegate-prompt-and-output.md` - delegated-worker prompt skeleton,
  status footer, report rules, and anti-patterns
