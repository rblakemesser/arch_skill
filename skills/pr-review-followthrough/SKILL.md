# PR Review Followthrough

Use this skill when the job is not "review a PR once" but "own an already-open PR until review feedback, CI, and merge-readiness are all clean."

## Install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:aelaguiz/arch_skill.git
cd arch_skill
make install
```

## When to use

- The user wants the agent to stay on a submitted PR and keep polling for new code-review feedback.
- The user wants every review item, inline comment, and top-level PR ask handled and replied to.
- The user wants the agent to push follow-up commits to the same branch until the PR is fully merge-ready.
- The user wants a convenience loop that keeps working while humans and CI continue to respond.

## When not to use

- The PR does not exist yet and the real job is PR drafting, branch prep, or PR description authoring.
- The user wants a one-shot code review, summary, or diff audit rather than a long-lived follow-through loop.
- The user wants automatic merging, merge-queue submission, or post-merge cleanup. This skill stops at merge-ready.
- The repo, branch, or GitHub client cannot be written to from the current environment.

## Preconditions

- A real PR URL or PR number already exists.
- The agent has authenticated GitHub access that can read PR state and write replies.
- The agent has a local checkout for the same repo and can push follow-up commits to the PR branch.
- The user is okay with the agent staying in a polling loop for minutes or longer until the stop line is met.

## Non-negotiables

- Treat this as explicit-invocation work. Do not start a long-lived polling loop unless the user directly asked for it.
- Poll live GitHub state on every pass. Do not trust stale local memory, notification summaries, or prior screenshots.
- Check the full PR surface each pass:
  - review decision / blocking review state
  - review submissions
  - inline review comments and replies
  - top-level PR comments / asks
  - required checks
  - mergeability, conflict state, and branch-behind state
- Reply to every actionable item on the exact GitHub surface that raised it, even when declining the change or pointing out that it is already fixed.
- Treat reviewer comments as claims and requests, not commands. Inspect the code, repo policy, product intent, and tests before changing code. Accept feedback that improves correctness, maintainability, consistency, or required policy. Decline or partially accept feedback that is already handled, overbroad, pedantic, out of scope, unsupported by repo truth, or likely to make the code worse. A no-code reply with evidence is a valid resolution.
- For plan-backed PRs, classify every actionable comment against the PR scope
  receipt and canonical plan. A technically valid comment outside the frozen
  contract, including a newly discovered adjacent same-contract path, is
  replied to and escalated to the named human scope decision owner; it is not
  implemented merely because a reviewer asked. Human reviewers authorize scope
  only when they are the relevant decision owner and their approval is explicit.
- A reviewer request, plan edit, reply thread, or repeated comment cannot
  retroactively authorize built scope. Scope cycling or unauthorized
  implementation prevents merge-ready until it is subtracted or explicitly
  human-approved and re-frozen.
- Prefer one branch, one PR, one coherent follow-through loop. Do not fork the work into side branches or parallel PRs unless the user explicitly wants that.
- After each accepted change, run the smallest relevant verification, push to the same PR branch, and continue polling.
- Stop at merge-ready. Do not click merge, enable auto-merge, or queue the PR unless the user separately asks for that.
- Fail loud on irreducible blockers:
  - missing GitHub write access
  - missing push access
  - conflicting reviewer direction that changes product or policy meaning
  - failing external systems the agent cannot repair from the repo
  - human-only decisions about scope, design, or release policy

## First move

1. Resolve the PR URL/number, repo, local branch, and current head SHA.
2. Read the repo's actual review-policy and CI surfaces if they exist.
   - Prefer repo-root `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, PR templates, review-policy files, and workflow files over memory.
   - For plan-backed PRs, read the scope receipt and its canonical plan anchors.
3. Capture a baseline PR snapshot:
   - draft/open state
   - head SHA
   - review decision / requested-changes state
   - required-check state
   - mergeability / behind / conflict state
   - inline review comments
   - top-level review bodies
   - top-level PR comments
4. Tell the user the loop is running and name the current blocker.

## Canonical loop

1. Snapshot the live PR again from GitHub.
2. Partition inputs into actionable buckets:
   - inline review comments and unresolved review threads
   - top-level review summaries with concrete asks
   - top-level PR comments requesting code, QA, docs, or explanation
   - failing required checks
   - mergeability / branch-update problems
3. For each actionable item, inspect the evidence and choose one disposition:
   - accept and fix when the feedback is valid and improves the PR
   - partially accept and fix the bounded part
   - decline with evidence when the feedback is wrong, already handled, pedantic, scope-expanding, or harmful
   - already handled, with a commit or reply pointer
   - blocked on an irreducible human decision
   - scope-expanding and awaiting the named human decision owner
4. Reply on the exact thread or comment surface that raised the item.
5. If a change was accepted:
   - make the smallest coherent patch
   - run the narrowest relevant verification
   - commit
   - push to the PR branch
6. After a push, resnapshot the PR and reset outstanding work against the new head SHA.
7. Wait a few minutes and repeat.
   - Default cadence is about 3 minutes.
   - Shorten only when the next signal is imminent, such as immediately after a push while required checks are starting.
   - Back off only when host constraints or rate limits force it.

## Actionability rules

- In this section, actionable means the item must be evaluated and answered. It does not mean the requested code change must be implemented.
- Treat these as actionable by default:
  - `CHANGES_REQUESTED`
  - new inline review comments
  - new top-level PR asks
  - failing required checks
  - merge conflicts
  - branch-behind / update-branch requirements
- Treat these as non-actionable once explicitly handled:
  - approvals
  - acknowledgements
  - duplicate notifications
  - already-replied stale comments that have not materially changed
- A review item is not done just because the code changed. It is done when:
  - the code path is updated if needed, and
  - the agent has replied on-thread with the disposition.
- If two reviewers conflict, do not guess. Summarize the conflict, take the safest bounded step if one exists, and escalate only if the disagreement changes product, policy, or merge authority.

## Merge-ready stop line

Consider the loop complete only when all of these are true:

- The PR is open and non-draft.
- The current head SHA has no unhandled actionable review items or top-level asks.
- The current head contains no unauthorized built scope or unresolved
  scope-cycling finding, and every scope-expanding comment has an explicit human
  decision or a documented decline.
- GitHub no longer shows blocking review state for the current head.
  - If the repo uses required reviews, the PR should be in the repo's approved / mergeable state rather than still waiting on blocking review.
- Required checks are green, or otherwise in the repo's accepted merge-ready state.
- The branch is mergeable, not conflicted, and not blocked on being behind base.
- Every accepted, partially accepted, declined, or already-fixed review item has a reply on the thread that raised it.

## Output expectations

- On start:
  - identify the PR and current head SHA
  - state the first blocker
- During the loop:
  - send concise progress updates only when the blocker changes materially
  - do not spam the user every poll cycle
- On completion:
  - give a short merge-ready summary with:
    - PR URL
    - final head SHA
    - review status
    - checks status
    - any residual human-only note before merge
- On failure:
  - state the exact blocker
  - state the last fully verified PR state
