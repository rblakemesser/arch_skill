# Bugs Flow

Use this skill for the bug workflow family: analyze, fix, and optionally review.

## When to use

- The ask is a bug report, regression, crash, incident, or Sentry investigation.
- The user has symptoms, logs, traces, QA notes, or a bug doc and wants the issue analyzed or fixed.
- The work should be driven by evidence and a single bug doc rather than by a feature plan.

## When not to use

- The user wants a repo-wide audit pass or leave-it-running defect hunt rather than one known bug. Use `audit-loop`.
- The work is planned feature delivery or architecture planning. Use `arch-step`, `arch-mini-plan`, or `lilarch`.
- The task is open-ended optimization or a broad investigation loop rather than a concrete bug. Use `goal-loop` or `north-star-investigation`.

## Non-negotiables

- Keep one canonical bug doc under `docs/bugs/`.
- Analyze first. Do not modify code in analyze mode.
- Prefer first-party evidence: Sentry, logs, traces, QA notes, repro steps, and code anchors.
- Only move into fix mode when the bug doc is fix-ready.
- Keep fixes minimal and localized. No runtime fallbacks, silent swallowing, or compatibility shims unless explicitly approved.
- External cross-model review happens only if the user explicitly asks for review or code review.
- Do not let "review" become an excuse to reopen generic architecture planning.

## First move

1. Read `references/bug-doc-contract.md`.
2. Read `references/shared-doctrine.md`.
3. Resolve the mode:
   - analyze
   - fix
   - review
4. Resolve `DOC_PATH` and read it fully if it already exists.
5. If the user asked for fix or review but the doc is not ready, step back and repair the investigation first.
6. Read the mode reference and `references/quality-bar.md`.

## Workflow

### 1) Analyze mode

- Create or repair the bug doc.
- Ingest evidence and write ranked hypotheses.
- Mark the issue fix-ready only when the likely root cause is concrete enough to act on.

### 2) Fix mode

- Read the bug doc as the spec.
- Write or tighten the fix plan in the doc.
- Implement the smallest credible fix locally.
- Update verification, risk level, and outcome in the doc.

### 3) Review mode

- Only when explicitly requested by the user.
- Audit the implementation against the bug doc.
- Integrate only the feedback you agree with.
- If no explicit review ask exists, do not launch review side work.

## Output expectations

- Update `DOC_PATH` in every mode.
- Keep console output short:
  - Bug North Star reminder
  - punchline
  - what changed
  - tests or evidence gathered
  - risks or blockers
  - next action

## Reference map

- `references/bug-doc-contract.md` - bug doc structure, evidence rules, Sentry handling, and status transitions
- `references/shared-doctrine.md` - evidence discipline, anti-fallback rules, and escalation boundaries
- `references/analyze.md` - create or repair the bug doc and make the issue fix-ready
- `references/fix.md` - implement the smallest credible fix and keep the doc truthful
- `references/review.md` - explicit-review-only audit behavior
- `references/quality-bar.md` - strong vs weak bars for evidence, fix-ready state, and verification
