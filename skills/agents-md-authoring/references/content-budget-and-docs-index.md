# Content Budget And Docs Index

Use this file when deciding what belongs inside always-on instructions, what should move out, and how to add a docs map without bloating prompt context.

## Always-on budget doctrine

`AGENTS.md` is expensive context. It rides along with work that may have nothing to do with the file itself.

Write with three assumptions:

- the agent already knows generic engineering practice
- the repo already encodes many conventions in code, config, and tooling
- the instruction budget is shared with the system prompt, conversation history, and tool results

A good `AGENTS.md` therefore prefers:

- compact rules
- exact commands
- exceptions to default behavior
- one short plain-English communication rule when the repo has a repeated jargon or meta-talk failure mode
- pointers to deeper docs

It rejects:

- motivational prose
- planning narration, retrospectives, and author notes
- generic style opinions
- copied architecture docs
- encyclopedic reference material

## Order the content by operational value

The most reliable ordering is:

1. **Setup, build, lint, test, and typecheck commands**
2. **Definition of done**
3. **Blocked-state and escalation rules**
4. **Dangerous paths, approvals, and red lines**
5. **Docs map, skills triggers, and source-of-truth pointers**
6. **Only then: non-standard conventions that are not already enforced elsewhere**

Why this order works:

- fresh agents need runnable commands before they need philosophy
- definition of done prevents false "finished" claims
- escalation rules prevent destructive improvisation when blocked
- docs pointers tell the agent where to go next without forcing every detail into prompt context

## Non-inferable detail only

The strongest research-backed rule is simple:

Only spend `AGENTS.md` budget on information the agent is likely to miss, misinfer, or need before it can safely explore.

High-value examples:

- `pnpm test packages/payments/src/foo.test.ts`
- "Never edit generated fixtures under `src/__snapshots__` by hand"
- "Use `make dev-api` before any integration test"
- "If schema or migration changes are needed, stop and ask"
- "Docs for the deploy flow live in `docs/deploy/index.md`"
- "Say `I installed it on this machine`, not `I completed the host-local cutover`"

Low-value examples:

- "We value clean code"
- "This repo uses React and TypeScript"
- "Prefer readable names"
- "This file helps agents plan their work across the repo"
- a full inventory of directories the agent can discover with `rg --files`

## Compressed docs index pattern

When the repo has more domain knowledge than should fit in `AGENTS.md`, add a compact docs map instead of copying full docs.

Goal:

- keep durable "where to look" context always visible
- let the agent fetch deeper docs on demand

Useful pattern:

```text
[Docs Index] root: ./docs/agent
| IMPORTANT: prefer retrieval-led reasoning over guesswork
| build/: {setup.md, ci.md, release.md}
| backend/: {api-contracts.md, auth.md, workers.md}
| frontend/: {design-system.md, routing.md, testing.md}
| data/: {migrations.md, seeds.md, privacy.md}
```

Rules for good indexes:

- compress paths, not prose
- include only directories or files the agent is likely to need during real work
- add one sentence of routing advice when the docs tree is easy to misuse
- keep names stable and literal
- prefer one compact map over several overlapping mini-maps

## Skills plus AGENTS integration

`AGENTS.md` and skills should complement each other:

- `AGENTS.md` supplies always-on repo rules
- skills supply on-demand, reusable procedures

Good pattern:

- "Before changing release metadata, call `$changeset-validation`."
- "If the task is skill design, call `$skill-authoring`."
- "For schema changes, read `docs/data/migrations.md` before editing migration files."

Do not move repo-global rules into skills. Do not move large reusable procedures into `AGENTS.md`.
Avoid self-referential routing such as telling the file to call `$agents-md-authoring` just to edit itself. `AGENTS.md` should route real repo work, not narrate or bootstrap its own authorship.

Agent dispatch is the same kind of boundary. If the repo tells agents to create,
resume, replace, or coordinate other model agents, keep one concise route to the
shared orchestration policy in `AGENTS.md` and leave the reusable transport,
context, continuation, isolation, topology, and integration doctrine in that
on-demand policy. Preserve only repo-specific ownership, safety, or path rules
locally, and make sure the policy pointer resolves in the target runtime.

## Anti-bloat checklist

Cut or move content when:

- it is discoverable from standard tool output
- it is already enforced by lint, test, CI, or code review tooling
- it duplicates README or architecture docs
- it explains a whole subsystem when a pointer would do
- it talks about how the file was written or what will be added later
- it contains more examples than rules
- it tries to solve multiple unrelated workflows in one always-on file

Keep content when:

- it prevents repeated failure
- it encodes a dangerous exception
- it exposes the right verification command
- it routes to the correct docs or skill
- it prevents repeated jargon-heavy or evasive replies with one short concrete rule
- it defines a real stop condition
