# Plan Conductor

Use this skill when the user wants an entire existing plan document implemented
by cheaper, faster coding workers while the smart parent agent preserves its
own context and serves as architect and deeply cynical reviewer.

The economics are the point. The parent runs on an expensive model whose value
is judgment, not keystrokes: it reads the plan once, designs well-sized slices,
delegates implementation through `$agent-delegate`, and spends its tokens on
evidence-based review. Workers run on fast, cheap models that implement,
repair, and run proof. The send-back loop — resume the same worker session with
batched audit findings until the slice contract is true in code — is what makes
cheap workers safe.

This is a prompt-first orchestration skill. It ships no runner, controller,
state machine, or script. The parent agent is the orchestrator; the conductor
log beside the plan is its durable memory.

## North Stars

- The plan goes in; verified, reviewed, plan-faithful code comes out.
- Parent tokens go to plan understanding, slice design, and cynical audit.
  Worker tokens go to implementation, repair, and proof runs.
- Chunk size balances two failure modes: micro-tasks turn the parent into a
  slow programmer with extra round-trips; mega-tasks produce unreviewable
  diffs. Default one plan phase per worker.
- Awareness without burn: a size-scoped background heartbeat on every slice
  proves liveness and catches a wedge early with cheap signals. Never tail
  raw worker event streams.
- Every worker return starts NOT ACCEPTED. Worker output — status, summary,
  quoted proof, labels — is a claims manifest to falsify against repo truth,
  never a report to consume. Current code is the only authority.

## Use When

- The user names an existing plan doc and wants the whole thing (or a phase
  range) implemented by delegated cheap/fast workers with the parent as
  reviewer.
- The user wants "smart parent, dumb fast hands": an expensive model checking
  work it did not write.
- The plan is arch-step, miniarch-step, arch-mini-plan, or lilarch shaped — or
  any format with recoverable requirements, phases, and done-ness.
- The user wants implementation velocity plus cost control on one long-running
  plan execution.

## Do Not Use When

- The plan does not exist yet. Use `$arch-step`, `$arch-mini-plan`, or
  `$lilarch`.
- The user wants the parent to implement the plan itself with native subagents
  only. Use `$plan-implement`.
- The user wants one concrete delegated task. Use `$agent-delegate`.
- The user wants a plan audited, not implemented. Use `$plan-audit`.
- The work is a multi-plan epic decomposition. Use `$arch-epic`.
- The workflow is a strict ordered process from another repo's doctrine. Use
  `$stepwise`.
- The user wants a read-only second opinion. Use `$fresh-consult`.

## Non-Negotiables

- The plan remains the single source of truth. The conductor log
  (`<PLAN_STEM>_CONDUCTOR_LOG.md` beside the plan) is schedule, evidence, and
  resume state — never a second plan.
- Whole plan is the default boundary; honor an explicit phase range exactly.
- Worker runtime and effort are supplied by the user. Model or profile is also
  supplied except that a Codex worker with no named model defaults to
  `gpt-5.6-sol`. Accept `sol`, `luna`, and `terra` as `gpt-5.6-sol`,
  `gpt-5.6-luna`, and `gpt-5.6-terra`. Ask one consolidated question for other
  missing execution values before launching. Provider routing is fixed: Codex
  runs GPT/GBT/OpenAI ids and Fugu profiles, Claude Code runs supported Claude
  models, Cursor Agent runs `composer-2.5-fast`, Grok runs `grok-build` or
  `grok-composer-2.5-fast`.
- Read the plan once, end to end, at intake. If it yields no observable
  done-ness anywhere — no requirements, checklists, exit criteria, or
  verification obligations — stop before dispatching any worker and report
  what is missing instead of inventing scope.
- The conductor never edits source code. It edits only coordination artifacts
  and plan completion annotations. It never edits the plan's requirements,
  checklists, or exit criteria to match what was built; scope changes escalate
  to the user.
- Delegation is `$agent-delegate` fresh-resumable by default. Repairs resume
  the exact captured session id through the same runtime. Never resume
  "latest"; never cross runtimes. Use fresh-one-shot only for the optional
  cold verifier.
- Every child prompt tells the child: "Maximize parallelism with native
  subagents or parallel-agent features provided by your current coding
  harness. Do not manually spawn separate coding-harness executables, or
  invoke skills whose main effect is to shell out to `codex`, `claude`,
  `agent`, or `grok`, from inside this child prompt unless the parent
  explicitly assigns that action."
- Chunk default is one plan phase per worker. Split only along owner
  boundaries the plan itself names; merge trivial adjacent phases that share
  one design intent; when unsure, chunk bigger. Never one file per worker,
  never micro-tasks, never two workers into one unsettled design decision.
- Parallelize only dependency-ready slices on disjoint surfaces. Serial
  execution is correct when the plan is serial.
- Arm a size-scoped background watchdog on every dispatched slice: heartbeat
  floor five minutes, ceiling thirty, scaled to the slice's expected
  duration. Each beat emits one compact liveness-and-progress line, relayed to
  the user as a brief check-in, plus a wedge alert when the worker dies, stalls
  with no progress across beats, or overruns its ceiling. This is standing
  practice on every dispatch, resume, and respawn — never wait for the user to
  ask for it, and never clear it after a slice and forget to re-arm the next.
  Cheap signals only; never stream `events.jsonl` into parent context during
  normal operation. Quiet with a live heartbeat is not stuck; act on evidence,
  not silence.
- Audit with inverted burden of proof before accepting any slice: enumerate
  the worker's claims, falsify them against git and current code, trace the
  authority path beyond the diff (side doors live in files the diff did not
  touch), and apply the integrity, architecture, and cruft lens groups from
  `references/audit-and-send-back.md`. Worker-quoted verification is a claim;
  decisive proof is independently reproduced by a different session before
  acceptance. A worker rebuttal never closes a finding without
  conductor-verified evidence. A clean pass must record which lying-modes
  were checked.
- Batch all accepted findings into one resume prompt per repair round. Caps:
  3 send-backs per session, then 1 fresh respawn with a sharpened brief, then
  escalate the slice and continue independent work. The same finding surviving
  two consecutive send-backs marks the session unhealthy immediately. Two
  consecutive malformed or failed child runs on one slice escalate it.
- Delegate all verification runs (tests, builds, generators, simulators) to
  workers. The parent runs only cheap read-only inspection commands. Reuse
  fresh passing proof; rerun only on a real invalidator.
- The parent commits local checkpoints after accepted slices and meaningful
  batches. It never pushes, never opens PRs. Workers never commit, push,
  stash, or revert unrelated work.
- Before phase closure, plan-required proof must be recorded passing. Before
  plan closure, run the final gate: one whole-plan cynical audit sweep plus a
  delegated fresh-one-shot cold verifier (default on; user may disable).
- Record completion the way the plan format already records it (for example
  `Status: COMPLETE` under arch phase headings plus a worklog entry, or
  checkbox ticks). Never hand-edit script-owned `arch_skill:block:*` receipt
  blocks and never write the `plan-audit` sidecar; those belong to their
  owning skills.
- Default wave cap is 25 (one wave = design, dispatch, wait, audit, route),
  user-tunable. When a cap or the readiness gate stops the run, report
  blockers plainly with the log as evidence; escalation is a first-class
  outcome, not a failure.

## First Move

1. Read `references/workflow-contract.md`.
2. Read `references/plan-intake-and-readiness.md`.
3. Resolve the plan path, boundary (whole plan unless the user named a phase
   range), worker runtime/model/effort, max parallelism, wave cap, and cold
   verifier toggle. Default an omitted Codex model to `gpt-5.6-sol`; ask one
   consolidated question only for other missing execution values.
4. Read the plan once end to end. Create or update
   `<PLAN_STEM>_CONDUCTOR_LOG.md` with the extracted execution map, and apply
   the readiness gate.
5. Inspect `git status` and commit an initial or resume checkpoint before
   launching workers, unless a concrete safety issue such as secrets blocks
   it.
6. Read `references/chunking-and-parallelism.md`, then design and dispatch
   the first wave.

## Workflow

1. Extract the plan into the conductor log: requirements, non-goals, phases
   with dependency order, per-phase checklist, verification, exit criteria,
   and cleanup/delete obligations — as anchors into the plan, not copied
   prose.
2. Each wave: pick the next dependency-ready slice or slices, sized by the
   chunking doctrine.
3. Dispatch each slice as an `$agent-delegate` fresh-resumable child using the
   worker prompt contract; record run directory and session id in the log.
4. Arm the slice's size-scoped watchdog, then wait patiently per the
   monitoring doctrine.
5. On return, audit per `references/audit-and-send-back.md`: enumerate the
   claims to falsify, check them against git, trace the authority path
   beyond the diff, apply the three lens groups, and require decisive proof
   to be independently reproduced. Triage findings as accepted, rejected
   (with conductor-verified evidence), or deferred (with rationale).
6. Route: batch accepted findings into one resume prompt and send the session
   back; or accept the slice with evidence anchors and commit a checkpoint;
   or respawn fresh; or escalate and continue independent slices.
7. When a phase's slices are accepted, delegate the phase's plan-required
   verification, record proof in the log, and record phase completion in the
   plan's own format.
8. Repeat until the execution map is clean or a hard stop triggers.
9. Run the final gate: whole-plan cynical audit sweep, the cynical review
   instruments when installed (`$cynical-code-review` by default for
   non-trivial plans, `$cynical-architecture-review` and
   `$cynical-cruft-removal` by judgment from what the plan changed), then
   the delegated cold verifier unless disabled. Triage and repair findings
   through the same send-back machinery.
10. Write the final report, commit the final checkpoint, and stop at the
    requested boundary.

## Progress Updates

After each wave and whenever the user asks for status, give one compact
Markdown table: slice, goal, worker/session, state, attempts, and current
blocker or next action. Refresh from the conductor log and repo state before
answering. Keep chat lean; detail lives in the log.

## Output

Report compactly:

- plan path, boundary, and conductor log path
- worker policy (runtime/model/effort) and max parallelism
- per-wave status table
- slices accepted, sent back, respawned, escalated, or deferred, with attempt
  counts
- proof run, reused, or still owed, with the invalidator reasoning
- findings triage summary and any rejected-finding evidence
- commits made, files changed, and plan completion annotations written
- escalations with the specific user decision each one needs
- next action or final verdict with evidence
