# Terra Delivery Shortcut

`plan-conductor terra` is the explicit end-to-end delivery preset for a user
who wants the standard high-rigor path without restating every handoff. It
composes existing skills; it does not replace their contracts or add a runner.

## Trigger Boundary

Activate this preset when the user explicitly asks for `plan-conductor terra`
or clearly asks for the standard Terra delivery path. A normal
`plan-conductor` request that happens to choose a Terra worker is still the
normal conductor workflow unless the user also asks for the preset's
worktree, three-review, and PR follow-through path.

The plan path or recoverable target plan is still required. Natural-language
scope such as an explicit phase range remains binding.

## Locked Policy

- Reuse a target-matching dedicated worktree when one exists; otherwise create
  one from the intended base branch using the repo's branch and worktree
  conventions. Reuse the current checkout when it is already the right
  dedicated worktree. Inspect `git worktree list --porcelain`, branch state,
  and existing PR state before choosing. Never delete, clean, or repurpose an
  unrelated worktree, and never move unknown uncommitted work between
  worktrees.
- Resolve `terra xhigh` exactly as
  `runtime=codex, model=gpt-5.6-terra, effort=xhigh`. Use that policy for
  implementation, repair, delegated verification, the cold verifier, and the
  three cynical review sessions. Do not ask for runtime, model, or effort and
  do not silently substitute another choice.
- The conductor owns plan interpretation, slice contracts, audit, finding
  triage, proof freshness, and the final acceptance decision. Terra workers
  own source edits and proof runs during the conductor stage.
- Keep the ordinary cold verifier enabled unless the user explicitly disables
  it. The three fresh cynical reviews satisfy and strengthen the ordinary
  cynical-instrument portion of the final gate; they do not duplicate direct
  instrument runs, and they do not replace the cold verifier.
- Keep the same worktree and branch through implementation, review repairs,
  PR publication, and PR follow-through.

## Delivery Path

1. **Worktree.** Select the safe matching worktree or create the dedicated
   worktree and branch. Record the worktree path and branch in the conductor
   log's Resume Snapshot.
2. **Conductor implementation.** Run the normal plan-conductor lifecycle with
   Codex `gpt-5.6-terra` at `xhigh`: intake, readiness, phase-sized
   fresh-resumable workers, independent verification, cynical parent audit,
   send-backs, checkpoints, plan completion annotations, whole-plan sweep,
   and cold verifier.
3. **Three independent reviews.** Once the conductor believes the plan is
   complete, use `$agent-delegate` to launch three fresh-one-shot Terra xhigh
   sessions, parallel when safe. Give each the plan path, exact review target,
   base/head boundary, and applicable repo instructions, but not the other
   reviewers' conclusions or the implementation story. Assign exactly one
   installed review skill per session:
   - `$cynical-code-review`
   - `$cynical-architecture-review`
   - `$cynical-cruft-removal`
4. **Triage and repair.** Treat every reviewer result as a claim. The conductor
   checks each finding against the plan and current repo, then records it as
   accepted, partially accepted, rejected with evidence, or deferred only
   when the plan and user allow deferral. Send accepted code changes to the
   healthy owning implementation session, or a fresh Terra xhigh repair worker
   when ownership or session health requires it. Independently reproduce the
   affected proof.
5. **Re-review.** A review is clean only at its own native clean verdict:
   `approve` for code and architecture, and `no-material-cruft-found` for
   cruft. After material repairs, rerun every affected review in another fresh
   Terra xhigh session. `coverage-incomplete`, `scope-incomplete`,
   `unsafe-to-judge`, or open required repairs do not pass the gate.
6. **Publish the PR.** After all plan proof and all three review lanes are
   clean, invoke `$pr-authoring` against the same branch and worktree. Let that
   skill inspect repo truth, publish or update the GitHub PR, and return the PR
   URL.
7. **Follow through.** Treat this preset as the user's explicit authorization
   to invoke `$pr-review-followthrough` on that PR. Poll live GitHub state,
   answer every actionable thread, make and verify warranted same-branch
   fixes, push, and continue until its merge-ready stop line is true. Do not
   merge, enable auto-merge, or enter a merge queue unless the user separately
   asks.

## Completion Line

The shortcut is complete only when the plan and conductor log are complete,
the cold verifier and all three fresh cynical review lanes are clean on the
accepted code, the PR exists, and `$pr-review-followthrough` reports the
current PR head merge-ready. A missing CLI, unsafe worktree state, unavailable
review skill, GitHub authorization failure, irreducible CI failure, or real
human product decision is a blocker to report, not a reason to skip a stage.
