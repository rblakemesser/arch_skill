# Conductor Log Contract

One sidecar file beside the plan: `<PLAN_STEM>_CONDUCTOR_LOG.md` (for
`docs/PAYMENTS_MIGRATION_2026-07-01.md`, the log is
`docs/PAYMENTS_MIGRATION_2026-07-01_CONDUCTOR_LOG.md`). It is schedule,
evidence, and resume state — never a second plan. Record facts and anchors,
not transcripts. The log must not contain secrets.

Do not write into surfaces other skills own: never hand-edit
`arch_skill:block:*` receipt blocks (script-owned) and never write
`<PLAN_STEM>_PLAN_AUDIT.md` (plan-audit owns it; read its open findings as
constraints).

## Field Rules

- **Status enum** for slices:
  `open | dispatched | auditing | sent-back | accepted | blocked | escalated | deferred`.
- **Size rationale** is one line saying why this chunk (whole phase, named
  owner-boundary split, merged trivial phases) — it makes the chunking
  judgment visible and reviewable.
- **Worker/session** names the runtime/model, the agent-delegate run
  directory, and the captured session id. The run directory path makes the
  session recoverable even if one record is lost.
- **Attempts** counts dispatch + send-backs + respawns toward the per-slice
  caps.
- **Evidence** for an `accepted` slice anchors the proof: diff anchors,
  independently reproduced verification results, checkpoint commit, plus a
  one-line refutation record naming which lens groups and lying-modes were
  checked — so a later reader can distinguish "audited" from "skimmed".
- **Proof Ledger** entries carry the freshness reasoning: what would force a
  rerun. Reuse passing proof until a recorded invalidator fires.
- **Wave History** is one compact line per wave — enough breadcrumbs to
  recover progress, not a narrative.

## Update Cadence

Update at meaningful boundaries — dispatch, return, triage, acceptance,
checkpoint, escalation — not after every micro-step. Keep the log short
enough that a resumed conductor can read it quickly; the Resume Snapshot is
the first thing a post-compaction parent reads.

## Exit Probe

The run is complete when all three hold:

1. Zero Execution Map rows outside `accepted`/`deferred`, and every
   `deferred` row carries user approval or an explicit rationale.
2. Every phase's plan-required verification is recorded passing in the Proof
   Ledger (fresh, or valid-until untouched).
3. The `Final gate:` header line reads `clean`.

A cheap approximate probe between waves (matches Execution Map status
cells; the map itself is authoritative):

```sh
grep -cE '\| *(open|dispatched|auditing|sent-back|blocked|escalated) *\|' <PLAN_STEM>_CONDUCTOR_LOG.md || true
```

Zero matches plus a clean final gate means done; anything else names the
remaining work.
