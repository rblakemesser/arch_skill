description: "Router + invariants for the arch_skill prompt suite. Use it to keep a single SSOT plan doc + worklog, enforce strict question policy, and route to the right /prompts:* command for architecture planning and execution."

# arch-skill

This skill runs **alongside** the existing `/prompts:*` commands:
- Use it to decide which prompt to run next and to enforce the workflow invariants.
- Then invoke the prompt directly (preferred) or load its markdown procedure on demand.

## When to Use
- User asks for architecture planning, a phased plan, a call-site audit, or "arch_skill flow".
- Work needs a single plan doc + worklog and minimal, credible verification.
- You want to route the user to the correct `/prompts:*` command (and keep the process consistent).

## Non‑Negotiables (Workflow Invariants)
- **Single-document rule (SSOT):** exactly one plan doc under `docs/` is authoritative. Worklog is derived from it.
- **Code is ground truth:** anchor claims in file paths/symbols/commands; do not speculate.
- **Minimal verification:** prefer existing tests/commands; avoid inventing new harnesses by default.
- **Question policy (strict):** only ask questions that cannot be answered by searching the repo/docs/fixtures or running existing tooling.
- **Output format:** when you invoke a prompt, follow that prompt's output format (don't restate style rules here).

## Routing Rule (How to "Load Prompts on Demand")
Prefer invoking prompts:
- Use `/prompts:<name> …` whenever possible (Codex/Claude Code handles placeholder expansion).

If you must **load the markdown procedure directly** (no `/prompts` invocation), then:
- Open the prompt file and follow it as the procedure.
- Apply the placeholder binding contract in `resources/BINDING_CONTRACT.md` (especially `$ARGUMENTS`).

Prompt discovery order:
1) Installed prompts (Claude Code): `~/.claude/commands/prompts/<name>.md`
2) Installed prompts (Codex): `~/.codex/prompts/<name>.md`
3) Repo prompts (when working inside this repo): `prompts/<name>.md`
