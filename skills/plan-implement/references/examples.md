# Examples And Anti-Examples

Use these as illustrations, not rigid templates.

## Clean Worklog Resume Snapshot

```markdown
## Resume Snapshot

- Current state: Phase 3 owner path is implemented for the primary command;
  legacy direct writer still needs deletion check.
- Next useful move: search old command and fixture entrypoints for direct
  writes before widening to adapters.
- Do not redo unless stale: command-service caller map read at
  `src/commands/*` and `src/session/*`; stale if those files change.
- Known blockers: none.
- Native subagents used or useful next: useful next for docs/prompts drift
  after side-door cleanup.
```

## Clean Proof Freshness Entry

```markdown
| Proof | Scope covered | Result/context | Fresh until | Rerun trigger |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `uv run pytest tests/test_command_service.py` | Primary command routes through canonical service | Passed locally | Command service, metadata schema, adapter registration, or caller routes change | Any touched path above, review finding about command routing, or plan-required final proof |
```

## Continuous Review Finding

```markdown
| Finding | Source | Status | Repair anchor | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IMP-002 old command still calls direct writer | deletion-and-side-door closure | open | `src/commands/legacy.py` | Blocks Phase 3 approval because the old write path remains reachable |
```

## Good Plan Update

Good: after code truth shows the old adapter must be deleted now, the plan's
delete list and phase exit criteria are updated with that surface and the proof
needed to confirm it is unreachable.

Why it is good: the plan stays source of truth instead of hiding the delete in
the implementation log.

## Anti-Example: Ceremony

Bad: update the plan, audit log, and implementation log after every tiny edit.

Why it is bad: the artifacts become slower than the work.

Better: update the owning artifact at meaningful boundaries.

## Anti-Example: Second Plan

Bad: the implementation log grows a new task list that changes the plan's
requirements.

Why it is bad: future agents now have two competing sources of truth.

Better: source-truth changes go into the plan; execution state goes into the
implementation log.

## Anti-Example: Test Rerun Treadmill

Bad: rerun the same broad suite after compaction because the chat no longer
contains the prior result.

Why it is bad: the implementation log should preserve proof freshness and stale
triggers.

Better: read the proof ledger, inspect whether relevant code changed, and rerun
only if stale or required.

## Anti-Example: Final Review Only

Bad: implement every caller first, then discover at the end that the owner path
or side-door assumption was wrong.

Why it is bad: late architecture findings are expensive.

Better: review the first narrow integrated slice, repair it, then widen.

## Anti-Example: External Harness Creep

Bad: manually shell out to `codex`, `claude`, `agent`, or `grok` because
parallelism sounds useful.

Why it is bad: that turns a lightweight implementation habit into a delegation
workflow.

Better: use native subagents when available. Use `plan-swarm` or
`agent-delegate` only when the user explicitly asks for external workers.
