# Progressive Implementation Loop

Use this as the main execution path. The goal is speed through fewer repeated
reads, fewer duplicate checks, and earlier review.

## 1. Resolve Scope

Read:

- the user request
- the plan artifact
- the active phase, section, checklist, or stop boundary
- the plan audit log when present
- the implementation log when present
- local instructions
- current worktree state

State the active scope plainly. Do not silently widen into adjacent phases,
whole-plan signoff, or unrelated cleanup.

Recover the plan's human authorization anchors, initial convergence closure,
scope-freeze boundary, and explicit later human approvals. If the plan cannot
support a defensible frozen boundary, stop for one human scope decision.

## 2. Choose The Next Narrow Slice

Choose the smallest depth-first slice that moves the plan toward its North Star
and crosses a meaningful integration seam.

Prefer slices that:

- make one requirement true end to end
- prove owner path and caller shape early
- delete or close one real side door
- reduce live concept count
- keep proof targeted

Avoid slices that:

- build broad scaffolding before integration
- add helpers, modes, wrappers, or config before proving the core path
- defer the risky seam until the end
- widen to more callers before the prior layer is real

## 3. Build The Local Truth Cache

Before editing, record the useful current facts in the implementation log:

- relevant plan anchors
- code areas read
- owner path and caller families
- adjacent same-contract or same-behavior surfaces
- each active item's scope disposition
- legacy paths and side doors found
- comparable patterns
- proof already fresh
- proof likely needed after this slice
- implementation-audit lenses likely to matter

This is a human cache, not a state machine. Keep it short.

## 4. Use Native Parallelism Where It Saves Time

When independent work would otherwise be serial, use
`native-subagent-contract.md` and the shared agent policy to decide whether
same-host native children save enough time to justify integration:

- code mapping
- side-door search
- existing-pattern comparison
- docs, prompts, examples, config, or generated-artifact drift checks
- changed tests reviewed as code
- one implementation-audit lens
- independent low-collision implementation slices when the host supports safe
  native parallel editing

Give each child a non-overlapping lens or owned path and keep fanout
proportional to the coverage or implementation split. Each new independent
child starts clean. Read-only children use the strongest capability available
plus an explicit no-edit/no-write prompt, and the parent checks repository
state before accepting their evidence.

The parent owns child accounting, synthesis, finding scope disposition,
source-truth updates, artifact updates, proof claims, and final claims.

Do not manually spawn separate coding-harness executables such as `codex`,
`claude`, or `agent` for ordinary acceleration.

## 5. Implement The Slice

Work through the repo's existing patterns:

- read the owning code and representative callers
- use the canonical owner path when possible
- make the smallest code change that makes the plan truth real
- delete old paths when the plan calls for replacement
- keep caller usage obvious
- move invariants into code or API shape, not developer memory
- avoid speculative abstractions and compatibility junk

## 6. Review While Warm

After a meaningful slice lands, do a plan-backed implementation review before
widening.

Use the relevant lenses from `plan-audit` implementation-audit doctrine:

- plan-code fit
- requirement traceability
- canonical owner and SSOT
- existing pattern fit
- convergence across adjacent same-contract or same-behavior surfaces
- deletion and side-door closure
- drift-proof coupling
- caller invariant state
- elegance and code-judo
- tiny-team maintainability
- changed tests as code
- docs, prompts, examples, config, or generated-artifact drift when triggered

For broad changes, split independent read-only lenses across new clean native
critics when that improves coverage. For small changes, review directly. Send
accepted repairs to the exact implementer that owns the code, then use a
different new clean critic for an independent recheck.

## 7. Verify Impact

Run, assign, or reuse proof because it buys confidence, not because it exists.

Run checks when:

- the plan requires them
- changed behavior needs proof
- a caller or integration seam could break
- generated artifacts, schemas, config, prompts, docs, or examples could drift
- prior proof is stale
- review findings need proof after repair
- an authorized review finding needs proof after repair

Reuse prior proof when:

- it covers the same behavior
- nothing touched can invalidate it
- the plan does not require fresh proof
- no review finding makes it suspect

Record proof freshness and stale triggers in the implementation log.

## 8. Close The Slice

Before widening:

- update the implementation log resume snapshot
- update scope ledger status with code and proof anchors
- update audit findings if any opened or closed
- update plan completion truth without rewriting scope
- record whether adjacent same-contract work is already in the frozen closure,
  `new-scope-needs-human`, or out of scope
- name which proof remains fresh and what would stale it
- name the next useful move

The slice is closed only when code state, plan state, review state, and proof
state agree.

## 9. Advance Through Authorized Breadth

Add the next caller, variant, platform, mode, or polish layer only when it is
already in the human-authorized plan or frozen initial convergence closure, and
only after the prior slice is implemented, reviewed, and sufficiently proven.

Depth-first sequencing orders frozen scope; it does not make new complexity
earn scope authority. Any other breadth requires explicit human approval and a
re-frozen contract.

## 10. Finalize The Requested Scope

At the stop boundary:

- read the implementation log resume snapshot
- read open audit findings
- confirm in-scope plan items are closed or explicitly not closed
- run a final lightweight plan-backed implementation check over the requested
  scope
- confirm adjacent surfaces in the frozen closure have converged and that new
  observations did not enter required work without human approval
- update plan, audit log, and implementation log so they tell the same story
- report remaining gaps plainly

The final answer can stay short because the artifacts hold the detail.
