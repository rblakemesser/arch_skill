# Arch Step Status

`status` is the compact read-only surface.

Use `advance` when the user wants the full checklist, the exact next command, or optional one-step execution.

## What status inspects first

Before grading stages, inspect the artifact itself:

- required frontmatter
- `# TL;DR`
- `planning_passes`
- `# 0) Holistic North Star`
- exact canonical top-level sections `# 1)` through `# 10)`
- required command-owned blocks
- `WORKLOG_PATH` and `implementation_audit` when implementation has started
- the relevant quality bars from `section-quality.md`

## What status reports

Report in this order:

1. Plan artifact
2. North Star
3. Research
4. Deep dive
5. External research
6. Phase plan
7. Implementation
8. Audit
9. Docs cleanup
10. Helper summary
11. Best next move

## Allowed grades

Use exactly:

- `strong`
- `decent`
- `weak`
- `missing`
- `not needed`

`not needed` is only for external research and helper commands.

## Artifact evidence rules

### Plan artifact

Inspect:

- required frontmatter
- `# TL;DR`
- `planning_passes`
- exact canonical headings for `# 0)` through `# 10)`
- whether the major sections agree with each other

Grade:

- `strong` when the doc is structurally canonical, the major sections have credible content, the core sections agree, adjacent-surface and compatibility-posture decisions are explicit, the artifact is decision-complete, and any instruction-bearing imported content is either preserved structurally or explicitly condensed with recoverable source text
- `decent` when the structure is mostly canonical but one important section is thin
- `weak` when the doc is usable but structurally drifted, partially canonical, missing multiple required sections, internally inconsistent, still contains unresolved plan-shaping decisions, silently omits adjacent surfaces or compatibility posture, or silently compresses instruction-bearing imported content
- `missing` when there is no credible canonical full-arch artifact

Also apply the "big 3" readiness bar:

- target architecture fully specified
- architecture sufficiently idiomatic and convergent
- call sites audited exhaustively enough within approved scope to trust the plan

A doc cannot be artifact-strong if TL;DR, Section 0, Section 5, Section 6, or Section 7 are still weak, or if unresolved decisions remain anywhere in the authoritative artifact.

### North Star

Inspect:

- frontmatter `status`
- `# TL;DR`
- `# 0) Holistic North Star`

Grade:

- `strong` when TL;DR and Section 0 are concrete, scoped, falsifiable, evidence-aware, clearly distinguish requested behavior scope from allowed convergence scope, make adjacent-surface scope and compatibility posture explicit, contain no unresolved plan-shaping decisions, and `status` is `active` or `complete`
- `decent` when the content is mostly real but thin in one important place
- `weak` when the draft is vague, contradictory, placeholder-heavy, or still leaves plan-shaping decisions unresolved
- `missing` when the doc is not credibly bootstrapped

### Research

Inspect:

- `arch_skill:block:research_grounding`
- or a semantically equivalent research section with the canonical structure

Grade:

- `strong` when the block has authoritative internal anchors, names the canonical owner path, names adjacent surfaces and compatibility posture, names reusable patterns, grounds prompt and capability surfaces when the system is agent-backed, names preservation signals when needed, and turns any remaining decision gaps into explicit blockers instead of hiding them
- `decent` when present but thinner than required
- `weak` when present but generic or under-anchored
- `missing` when absent

### Deep dive

Inspect:

- `arch_skill:block:current_architecture`
- `arch_skill:block:target_architecture`
- `arch_skill:block:call_site_audit`
- `planning_passes`

Grade:

- `strong` when current architecture is grounded, target architecture is fully specified, the canonical owner path is explicit, adjacent surfaces and compatibility posture are explicit, agent-backed behavior is split cleanly between prompt/capability use and deterministic code when relevant, the call-site audit is exhaustive enough within approved scope to drive implementation and audit, and no architecture-shaping decisions remain unresolved
- `decent` when all exist but one is still thin
- `weak` when one or more exist but do not meet the depth bar
- `missing` when one or more are absent

Also report whether pass 1 or pass 2 has been completed.

### External research

Inspect:

- `arch_skill:block:external_research`
- `planning_passes.external_research_grounding`

Grade:

- `strong` when the block uses narrow relevant topics, authoritative sources, and clear adopt or reject guidance for this plan
- `decent` when useful but thin
- `weak` when present but not truly synthesized
- `missing` when warranted but absent
- `not needed` when the plan is repo-local and external best practice does not materially affect correctness or idiomatic design

### Phase plan

Inspect:

- `arch_skill:block:phase_plan`

Grade:

- `strong` when the authoritative phased plan exists, remains the single execution checklist, protects the destination map, starts with a real working slice through the canonical owner path and highest-risk seam, expands later work along named axes, chooses phase count from proof gates rather than a preset range, gives each phase concrete work, an explicit exhaustive checklist, verification, exhaustive exit criteria, and rollback, names preservation checks for refactor-heavy phases, makes adjacent-surface and cutover or preservation work explicit, deletes or rewrites touched live docs/comments that would otherwise go stale in the plan, explicitly justifies agent-backed tooling against prompt-first options, and contains no unresolved branches or "decide later" language
- `strong` also requires that `Work` stay explanatory, no required obligation is stranded outside `Checklist` or `Exit criteria`, and the exit criteria are concrete enough for audit to validate without guessing
- `decent` when present but one or more phases are thin
- `weak` when generic, incomplete, blends coherent units into oversized phases, omits or underspecifies phase checklists, strands required obligations outside the authoritative phase-exit surface, uses vague or non-auditable exit criteria, mixes product creep into ship-blocking work, leaves touched live docs/comments cleanup implicit, competes with helper checklists, or still contains unresolved execution choices
- `missing` when absent

### Implementation

Inspect:

- `WORKLOG_PATH`
- phase status updates in `DOC_PATH`
- implementation progress notes that match the implementation contract

Grade:

- `strong` when worklog and doc both reflect real phased progress or completion against the Section 7 checklist and exit criteria, required proof and required docs/comments propagation are visible where phase completeness depends on them, Section 7 phase status lines match the worklog, ledger-like completeness is visible, refactor-heavy phases ran preservation checks, touched live docs/comments that would otherwise go stale were cleaned up when needed, agent-backed changes leaned on the planned prompt or capability path before new tooling, and the doc matches reality
- `decent` when implementation is real but progress truth is thin
- `weak` when there are claims of progress or completion without credible worklog or doc evidence for checklist completion, required proof, or exit-criteria satisfaction
- `missing` when no implementation evidence exists

### Audit

Inspect:

- `arch_skill:block:implementation_audit`
- reopened phase notes

Grade:

- `strong` when the audit block is evidence-anchored, reopened phases are updated in place, missing code is clearly separated from manual verification, the audit validates both checklist items and exit criteria for modern phases, touched live docs/comments that would otherwise go stale are treated as implementation gaps when warranted, and unjustified scaffolding around agent-backed behavior is treated as an implementation gap
- `decent` when present but thin
- `weak` when nominal but not convincingly reconciled, or when exit-criteria validation is missing, vague, or clearly incomplete
- `missing` when absent

### Docs cleanup

Inspect:

- whether `Verdict (code): COMPLETE` is already present
- whether `DOC_PATH` and `WORKLOG_PATH` still exist as live feature residue
- whether the next required move is now the `arch-docs` handoff

Grade:

- `strong` when the code audit is clean and the artifact is ready to hand off to `arch-docs`
- `decent` when the code audit is close but still thin
- `weak` when the code audit is incomplete or the docs-cleanup handoff is still unclear
- `missing` when there is no credible audit state yet

## Helper summary rules

- `plan-enhance` is present when `arch_skill:block:plan_enhancer` exists
- `fold-in` is present when `arch_skill:block:reference_pack` exists
- `overbuild-protector` is present when `arch_skill:block:overbuild_protector` exists
- `consistency-pass` is present when `arch_skill:block:consistency_pass` exists
- `review-gate` is present when `arch_skill:block:review_gate` exists

Summarize helpers in one compact line. Example:

- `Helpers are mixed: plan enhancer is strong, fold-in is decent, overbuild protector is missing, consistency pass is strong, review gate is not needed.`

## Output shape

Keep the output compact and human:

- one short line for the artifact
- one short line per core stage
- one short helper line
- one short `Best next move:` line

Do not emit the longer `advance` checklist here.

## Best-next-move rule

Choose the command that most improves artifact completeness or core-flow progress:

- no canonical doc yet -> `new`
- non-canonical existing doc -> `reformat`
- draft or weak North Star -> confirm or repair via `reformat`
- missing research -> `research`
- weak or incomplete current architecture, target architecture, canonical-path analysis, or call-site audit -> `deep-dive`
- warranted but missing external research -> `external-research`
- weak, creep-heavy, missing capability-first analysis, preservation-light, adjacent-surface-light, compatibility-implicit, or stale-live-doc-light execution checklist -> `phase-plan`
- execution-grade plan still has obvious end-to-end consistency drift that warrants a dedicated cold read -> `consistency-pass`
- unresolved decision gap that repo truth cannot settle -> ask the user the exact blocker question and do not route to implementation
- code progress without worklog truth -> `implement`
- missing implementation audit -> `audit-implementation`
- clean implementation audit with remaining docs cleanup or plan/worklog retirement -> `Use $arch-docs`
