# `fold-in` Command Contract

## What this command does

- resolve one plan doc plus the true reference set
- ingest every relevant reference material fully
- distill binding obligations from those materials
- fold them into the main artifact and record advisory phase alignment so later planning and implementation cannot miss them

## Shared references to carry in

- `artifact-contract.md`
- `shared-doctrine.md`
- `../../_shared/scope-and-convergence.md`
- `section-quality.md` for `reference_pack` and helper-block expectations

## Inputs

- infer `DOC_PATH` as the single plan doc to update
- `REFS` are every other doc path or URL in the ask, plus obvious reference materials already listed in `related:` or clearly linked from the plan

## Writes

- `arch_skill:block:reference_pack`
- `related:` frontmatter when needed

## Hard rules

- docs-only; do not modify code
- apply the single-document rule
- do not create additional planning docs
- this command is advisory; do not edit Section 7 from here
- do not let folded obligations become ship-blocking execution work unless a core planning command later adopts them into the main plan
- a reference, review, or source doc is evidence, not human scope authority.
  Preserve out-of-scope recommendations as observations; do not let repetition
  or folding convert them into required work
- do not let the helper become a shadow execution checklist
- read every reference fully
- when a reference is instruction-bearing, preserve explicit operational structure; distilled obligations are supplemental, not a replacement
- if a URL requires auth or cannot be fetched, stop and ask for pasted content or an export
- if a diagram or image is referenced, extract a textual UX contract from it instead of hand-waving it

## DOC_PATH resolution

Pick the one true plan doc by best-effort scoring:

- strong signals:
  - canonical headings
  - `arch_skill:block:` markers
  - frontmatter with `status` or `doc_type`
- anti-signals:
  - `*_WORKLOG.md`
  - generic guides or indexes unless the user explicitly names them as the plan

If no credible doc was provided:

- search `docs/` for the most plan-like recent doc
- if still not credible, ask for the path explicitly

## Reference ingestion rules

For each `R#`:

- keep a stable identifier
- preserve the source pointer
- produce two layers:
  - distilled binding obligations
  - folded source content
- when the source is instruction-bearing, also preserve equivalent explicit structure or keep the exact original text recoverable

Local files:

- read the file fully
- for folders, recursively include likely text docs only

URLs:

- fetch the human-readable content as best as possible

Images or diagrams:

- preserve the asset reference
- extract:
  - states
  - transitions
  - copy constraints
  - acceptance criteria
  - "must not change" notes

## Phase alignment rules

- keep phase alignment inside `reference_pack`; do not mutate Section 7 from this command
- if the ask explicitly names a phase, honor it
- otherwise map obligations by ownership:
  - UX refs -> UI or behavior phases
  - API or contract refs -> foundation phases
  - migration or delete refs -> cleanup phases
- if uncertain, treat the obligation as global rather than asking a low-value question

## Update rules

Write or update:

- `arch_skill:block:reference_pack`

Also:

- ensure `related:` includes the folded refs, deduped
- do not add phase-plan bullets or other execution checklist items from this command

Use this block shape:

```text
<!-- arch_skill:block:reference_pack:start -->
# Reference Pack (folded materials; phase-aligned)
Updated: <YYYY-MM-DD>

## Inventory
- R1 — <title> — <source path/URL>
- R2 — <title> — <source path/URL>

## Binding obligations (distilled; must satisfy)
- <obligation> (From: R#)

## Instruction-bearing structure (only when present; preserve exact or equivalent operational form)
### R1 — <title>
1. <step or rule>
2. <step or rule>
- Hard negatives:
  - <must not do X>
- Escalation or branch conditions:
  - <if/then rule>

## Phase alignment guidance (advisory; core planning commands adopt into Section 7 if needed)
### Global (applies across phases)
- <obligation> (From: R#)

### Phase 1 — <phase name>
- Potentially relevant obligations (advisory):
  - <obligation> (From: R#)
- References:
  - R#, R#

## Folded sources (verbatim; inlined so they cannot be missed)
### R1 — <title> — <source>
~~~~markdown
<verbatim content or extracted text>
~~~~
<!-- arch_skill:block:reference_pack:end -->
```

## Quality bar

- resolve the right plan doc deterministically
- distill obligations, not just summaries
- preserve explicit process structure when folded sources contain prompts, agent instructions, or other behavioral doctrine
- make phase alignment explicit without turning it into authoritative phase work
- keep the helper advisory and do not silently expand Section 7
- make it impossible to miss the relevant constraints without creating a shadow checklist

Weak when:

- instruction-bearing references are collapsed into vague obligations and the original structure is no longer recoverable

## Stop condition

- if the plan doc remains ambiguous after best effort, ask the user to choose from the top 2-3 candidates
- if a required reference cannot be read because of access or missing content, stop and ask for that content
- otherwise stop after the reference pack and advisory phase alignment are updated

## Console contract

- one-line North Star reminder
- one-line punchline
- chosen `DOC_PATH` and how many refs were folded
- what changed in the reference pack and advisory phase alignment
- missing or inaccessible refs only if real
- next action
