# `review-gate` Command Contract

## What this command does

- run a local idiomatic and completeness review against the plan and key repo anchors
- integrate the feedback you agree with into the main plan
- record the review outcome in one helper block

## Shared references to carry in

- `artifact-contract.md`
- `shared-doctrine.md`
- `section-quality.md` for the plan sections most relevant to the current change

## Hard rules

- docs-only; do not modify code
- keep this review local
- do not use external reviewer CLIs or other-model consultations from this command
- read `DOC_PATH` plus the key code anchors needed to answer the review question
- if the North Star, requested behavior scope, allowed architectural convergence scope, or any other plan-shaping decision is contradictory, stop and ask the exact blocker question first

## Core review question

Ask the same question every time:

- `Is this idiomatic, convergent, complete, and decision-complete relative to DOC_PATH? Are we routing through the canonical existing path? Did we add a new way to do something unnecessarily? Did we understand the relevant agent and model capabilities before designing? Are we replacing prompt or native-capability work with scaffolding? Did we silently compress any instruction-bearing content while porting it? What is missing? Where does code or plan drift? Are there any unresolved decisions, unauthorized scope cuts, SSOT gaps, contract gaps, behavior-preservation gaps, or stale-live-doc gaps?`

If suggesting tests:

- suggest only high-signal, refactor-resistant checks
- require behavior-preservation checks for refactors, consolidations, and shared-path extractions
- reject negative-value tests such as deletion proofs, visual-constant noise, doc-driven gates, or mock-only interaction tests
- if an existing test suite is obviously negative value, call out deletion or rewrite

Also check:

- whether sharp edges or new SSOTs need short, high-leverage boundary comments
- whether touched live docs, comments, or instructions should be deleted or rewritten instead of being left around as legacy explanation
- whether the real lever is prompt repair, grounding, or existing capability use rather than new tooling
- whether prompts, agent instructions, or other instruction-bearing content were condensed without an explicit rationale and recoverable source text

## Writes

- `arch_skill:block:review_gate`
- any real plan sections that should change after accepted review feedback

## Update rules

Integrate accepted changes into the main artifact first.

Then write or update:

- `arch_skill:block:review_gate`

Use this block shape:

```text
<!-- arch_skill:block:review_gate:start -->
## Review Gate
- Reviewers: self
- Question asked: "Is this idiomatic, convergent, complete, and decision-complete relative to DOC_PATH? Are we routing through the canonical existing path? Did we add a new way to do something unnecessarily? Did we understand the relevant agent and model capabilities before designing? Are we replacing prompt or native-capability work with scaffolding? Did we silently compress any instruction-bearing content while porting it? What is missing? Where does code or plan drift? Are there any unresolved decisions, unauthorized scope cuts, SSOT gaps, contract gaps, behavior-preservation gaps, or stale-live-doc gaps?"
- Feedback summary:
  - <item>
- Integrated changes:
  - <item>
- Unresolved decisions:
  - <item or `none`>
- Unauthorized scope cuts:
  - <item or `none`>
- Decision: proceed to next phase? (yes/no)
<!-- arch_skill:block:review_gate:end -->
```

Insert near the end before the Decision Log when possible.

## Quality bar

- identify plan drift, missing work, SSOT issues, contract violations, needless new code paths, unjustified scaffolding around agent behavior, silent compression of instruction-bearing content, missing preservation evidence, and stale live docs/comments left behind
- identify unresolved decisions and unauthorized scope cuts before they are allowed to reach implementation
- improve the main artifact rather than merely commenting on it
- keep the helper block short and decision-oriented

## Stop condition

- if the doc path remains truly ambiguous after best effort, ask the user to choose from the top 2-3 candidates
- if the North Star, requested behavior scope, allowed architectural convergence scope, or any review-blocking decision is contradictory or unresolved, stop and ask the exact blocker question
- otherwise stop after the accepted review feedback is integrated and the helper block is current

## Console contract

- one-line North Star reminder
- one-line punchline
- what the review changed
- remaining risks
- next action
