# `auto-plan` Command Contract

## What this command does

- take one approved canonical full-arch doc through the planning arc automatically
- run `research`, then `deep-dive`, then `deep-dive` again, then `phase-plan`
- use the installed Codex runtime continuation support to move stage to stage
- stop after planning is complete and hand off cleanly to `implement-loop`
- keep `DOC_PATH` and loop state aligned while the controller is armed

## Planning North Star

Running `auto-plan` should end in one of two honest states:

- `ready`:
  - research grounding is present
  - deep-dive pass 1 is present
  - deep-dive pass 2 is present
  - the authoritative phase plan is present
  - no implementation has started
  - the final message says the doc is ready for `implement-loop`
- `blocked`:
  - the controller state is cleared
  - the blocker or early stop is explicit
  - the run stops instead of silently pretending the planning arc finished

User-facing invocation is just `auto-plan`. Do not run the Stop hook yourself. After the controller is armed, just end the turn and let Codex run the installed Stop hook. If the installed runtime support for real automatic sequencing is absent or disabled, this command must fail loud instead of pretending prompt-only chaining is the same feature.

## Shared references to carry in

- `artifact-contract.md`
- `shared-doctrine.md`
- `section-quality.md` for Section 3, Section 4, Section 5, Section 6, Section 7, and `planning_passes`
- `arch-research.md`
- `arch-deep-dive.md`
- `arch-phase-plan.md`

## Inputs and `DOC_PATH` resolution

- treat the user ask as steering plus any planning preferences
- if the ask includes a `docs/<...>.md` path, use it
- otherwise resolve `DOC_PATH` from the normal `arch-step` defaults
- if the current session just created or most recently updated one canonical full-arch doc, prefer that doc
- if the doc path is truly ambiguous after best effort, ask the user to choose from the top 2-3 candidates

## Writes

- `DOC_PATH`
- `planning_passes`
- `.codex/auto-plan-state.<SESSION_ID>.json`

## Required runtime preflight

Before arming the controller, verify all of these:

- Codex runtime is the active host
- the installed Codex runtime support for this repo's automatic controller surface is present
- the installed `arch-step` runner exists under `~/.agents/skills/arch-step/`
- `codex features list` shows `codex_hooks` enabled
- the target doc exists and frontmatter `status` is `active` or `complete`

If any check fails, name the broken prerequisite and stop.

Do not downgrade to prompt-only same-session chaining.

## Active planning-state contract

Resolve `SESSION_ID` from `CODEX_THREAD_ID`, then create `.codex/auto-plan-state.<SESSION_ID>.json` before the first research pass.

Minimal shape:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "command": "auto-plan",
  "session_id": "<SESSION_ID>",
  "doc_path": "docs/<PLAN>.md",
  "stage_index": 0,
  "stages": ["research", "deep-dive-pass-1", "deep-dive-pass-2", "phase-plan"]
}
```

Lifecycle:

- create or refresh it after preflight and before the research pass
- write the current `session_id` into the state file at arm time
- leave it armed while automatic planning is active
- advance `stage_index` only after the required canonical outputs for that stage were updated
- delete it when phase-plan finishes
- delete it before stopping on a blocker, ambiguity, or other early stop so the controller does not re-enter falsely

## Hard rules

- docs-only; do not modify code
- this command is a bounded controller over `research`, `deep-dive`, `deep-dive`, and `phase-plan`; do not invent a second planning surface
- `auto-plan` is one command; if the required runtime continuation support is absent or disabled, fail loud
- use the same `DOC_PATH` for every stage in the controller
- the second `deep-dive` pass is required for this controller even when external research was not run
- in Codex, the installed runtime continuation path owns stage-to-stage continuation
- planning stages stay in the same visible session; do not hide them in silent child planning runs
- if a stage stops before it updates the required canonical outputs, clear `.codex/auto-plan-state.<SESSION_ID>.json`, stop, and report that truth plainly
- after `phase-plan`, clear `.codex/auto-plan-state.<SESSION_ID>.json`, stop, and say the doc is ready for `implement-loop`
- do not auto-run `external-research`, helper commands, `implement`, `implement-loop`, or `audit-implementation`

## Stage completion signals

Use these signals before continuing automatically:

- `research`:
  - `arch_skill:block:research_grounding` is present and was updated in this stage
- `deep-dive` pass 1:
  - `arch_skill:block:current_architecture` is present
  - `arch_skill:block:target_architecture` is present
  - `arch_skill:block:call_site_audit` is present
  - `planning_passes` marks `deep_dive_pass_1: done <YYYY-MM-DD>`
- `deep-dive` pass 2:
  - the same three architecture blocks are present
  - `planning_passes` marks `deep_dive_pass_2: done <YYYY-MM-DD>`
- `phase-plan`:
  - `arch_skill:block:phase_plan` is present and was updated in this stage

## Controller procedure

1. Read `DOC_PATH` fully and run the same alignment checks required by the planning commands it will invoke.
2. Run the runtime preflight. If the installed continuation path or `codex_hooks` is unavailable, fail loud.
3. Resolve `SESSION_ID` from `CODEX_THREAD_ID`, then create or refresh `.codex/auto-plan-state.<SESSION_ID>.json` for the current Codex session and `DOC_PATH`.
4. Run one truthful `research` pass using the `research` contract.
5. Let Codex try to stop. The installed runtime should:
   - no-op when no active auto-plan state matches the current session
   - after `research`, continue to `deep-dive` pass 1
   - after `deep-dive` pass 1, continue to `deep-dive` pass 2
   - after `deep-dive` pass 2, continue to `phase-plan`
   - after `phase-plan`, clear state and stop with the `implement-loop` handoff message
6. On each hook-driven continuation, run the literal next planning command against the same `DOC_PATH`, keep the controller state aligned, and stop naturally after the stage finishes.
7. If a stage ends early, does not update the required canonical outputs, or the next move is no longer credible, clear `.codex/auto-plan-state.<SESSION_ID>.json`, stop, and report that state plainly.

## Console contract

- one-line North Star reminder
- one-line punchline
- ordinary stage output should stay visible because the planning commands run in the same session
- the final stop message should name `DOC_PATH` and say it is ready for `implement-loop`
