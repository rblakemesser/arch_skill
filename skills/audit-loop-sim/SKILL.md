# Audit Loop Sim

Use this skill when the job is to exhaustively map a mobile app, its journeys, and its current automation surface, rank the strongest automation risk fronts by consequence, reduce the biggest unresolved real-app automation risks without changing contracts, and audit each resulting change before it counts as done.

## When to use

- The user wants a repo-wide simulator or emulator automation pass rather than help with one already-known bug.
- The user wants the agent to build a full mental model of the app and automation surface before acting.
- The user wants to find and close real-app blind spots, weak critical-path automation, or missing end-to-end coverage in priority order.
- The user wants to run one manual pass now or leave the automation audit running in Codex until the worthwhile work is exhausted.

## When not to use

- The task is a concrete known bug, crash, regression, or Sentry issue. Use `bugs-flow`.
- The work is a general repo bug hunt, dead-code sweep, or duplication cleanup rather than a real-app automation audit. Use `audit-loop`.
- The work is fixed-scope feature delivery or architecture planning. Use `arch-step`, `arch-mini-plan`, or `lilarch`.
- The task is manual QA only, a release checklist, or an open-ended optimization loop where the main job is not closing real-app automation risk. Use `goal-loop` or `north-star-investigation`.

## Non-negotiables

- `_audit_sim_ledger.md` at repo root is the source of truth. Add it to the root `.gitignore` immediately.
- Triage before code changes. Do not skip straight to editing because one suspicious line looks fixable.
- Exhaustively map app surfaces, user journeys, and the current automation surface before any product-code or automation edits. If the map is incomplete, update the ledger and stop.
- When the runtime supports delegation, use parallel read-only agents during mapping. Otherwise build the same exhaustive map sequentially.
- Rank consequence and impact first, then proof weakness, then fragility. Do not let a tiny safe automation tweak outrank a higher-consequence journey or surface.
- Select a risk front from the completed map, not from a hunch.
- Fix bugs inside the existing product, journey, and automation contracts. If the only apparent fix would change a contract, log the conflict and stop.
- Verification depth must be proportional to downstream consequence and blast radius.
- Every editful pass must run a post-change audit on the actual diff and touched surfaces for safety, downstream consequences, elegance, and duplication before it can stop.
- If that audit fails, repair the issue in the same pass and re-verify before stopping.
- New duplication is illegal. Do not solve a journey or automation front by copying product logic, lane behavior, harness steps, or fallback handling into a second place.
- Use the repo's canonical simulator or device surface and existing automation stack. If the repo ships `mobile-sim`, use `mobile-sim` for simulator or device control instead of inventing a parallel command story.
- Reduce the top unresolved real-app automation risk materially. Do not cash out a pass on a tiny safe test tweak while a bigger justified journey gap still dominates the app.
- It is acceptable and often necessary to touch product code, integration tests, harness helpers, fixtures, native glue, or QA surfaces when they belong to the same automation risk story.
- Broader same-story cleanup is allowed when the post-change audit shows the current fix is awkward or duplicative, but keep it inside the same contract and risk front. Do not build a framework or a parallel harness family.
- If the new automation exposes a same-story app bug, fix it in the same pass instead of leaving a knowingly broken lane behind.
- Prefer behavior-level end-to-end proof on meaningful journeys. Do not write negative-value automation.
- Do not decide that simulator or device work is annoying and quietly downgrade a real-app risk front into Flutter unit or widget tests. Work the sanctioned simulator path for a while, and if it still cannot produce the required real-app signal, stop blocked and name that blocker plainly.
- When iOS simulator is available and the risk is not platform-specific, use iOS for faster iteration and close with one Android confirmation for the same journey before calling a cross-platform risk front done.
- If the current context cannot inspect the sanctioned simulator or device surface for review-only reasons such as sandbox access, host permission errors, or wrapper failures, record the live state as `unknown`. Do not call that alone `BLOCKED`.
- Before declaring a simulator or device front blocked, do one bounded recovery on the sanctioned surface or one bounded host-health recovery when the sanctioned surface lacks the required repair command.
- If repeated cloud runs fail with the same lane-independent provider or infrastructure error and no meaningful app signal, stop honestly and record the provider blocker instead of rerunning the same lane.
- Unrelated dirty or untracked files are not a blocker. Leave them alone unless they directly conflict with the current automation risk front or make verification unsafe.
- Default invocation with no mode is `run`.
- `review` is docs-only.
- `auto` is Codex-only and must fail loud when the repo-managed `Stop` entry in `~/.codex/hooks.json`, the installed runner at `~/.agents/skills/arch-step/scripts/arch_controller_stop_hook.py`, or `codex_hooks` is missing.
- Missing or deleted auto-controller state is not verdict truth. Repair the state file or ledger from fresh repo context before honoring a stop decision.
- No auto commits. Keep the ledger truthful without relying on git history.

## First move

1. Read `references/ledger-contract.md`.
2. Read `references/shared-doctrine.md`.
3. Resolve the mode:
   - `run`
   - `review`
   - `auto`
4. Resolve repo root, root `.gitignore`, `_audit_sim_ledger.md`, and `.codex/audit-loop-sim-state.<SESSION_ID>.json` when in `auto`, with `SESSION_ID` taken from `CODEX_THREAD_ID`.
5. Read the matching mode reference and `references/quality-bar.md`.

## Workflow

### 1) `run`

- Create or repair `_audit_sim_ledger.md` and the `.gitignore` entry.
- Build or refresh the exhaustive map of app surfaces, user journeys, and the current automation surface.
- If the map is incomplete, record the next unfinished mapping tranche in `Next Area`, update the ledger, and stop without edits.
- Once the map is complete, rank automation risk fronts by consequence first, then proof weakness, then fragility.
- Pick the highest-priority unresolved automation risk front from that ranking and record the pre-edit proof plan plus the post-change audit focus.
- Read the implementation and current automation before patching, log findings, and fix the strongest justified work across that risk front.
- When the repo provides `mobile-sim`, use it for simulator or device management. If the current front needs simulator or device proof, do not replace that with Flutter unit or widget tests just because the simulator path is hard; either recover it or stop blocked.
- Verify the changes with proof proportional to the front's consequence.
- Audit the resulting diff and touched surfaces for safety, unintended downstream consequences, elegance, and duplication. If any lens fails, repair it in the same pass and re-verify.
- Update the ledger and stop only when further useful work would require a genuinely different automation story, a new reconnaissance pass, or a real blocker.

### 2) `review`

- Stay docs-only.
- Repair the ledger if it is missing or malformed.
- Re-read the ledger and current repo state from fresh context.
- Confirm whether the map is complete, whether the current or next front comes from the ranked map, and whether verification depth matched the front's consequence.
- Confirm whether the latest editful pass completed and passed the post-change audit for safety, downstream consequences, elegance, and duplication.
- Set the controller verdict to `CONTINUE`, `CLEAN`, or `BLOCKED` and name the next mapping tranche, automation risk front, or blocker plainly.

### 3) `auto`

- Run Codex-only preflight for hooks and feature flags.
- Derive `SESSION_ID` from `CODEX_THREAD_ID`, then create or refresh `.codex/audit-loop-sim-state.<SESSION_ID>.json`.
- Do not run the Stop hook yourself. After `auto` is armed, just end the turn and let Codex run the installed Stop hook.
- Run one truthful `run` pass. The first turns may be mapping-only.
- Let the installed Stop hook launch a fresh `review` pass and continue only while the verdict stays `CONTINUE` because mapping work or real unresolved automation risk still remains.

## Output expectations

- Update `_audit_sim_ledger.md` in every mode.
- Keep console output short:
  - automation North Star reminder
  - punchline
  - current mapping tranche, automation risk front, or verdict
  - evidence or tests run
  - next action

## Reference map

- `references/ledger-contract.md` - root ledger shape, controller block, status vocabulary, and cleanup lifecycle
- `references/shared-doctrine.md` - prioritization, fix discipline, and anti-patterns
- `references/run.md` - mapping-aware automation audit or fix pass
- `references/review.md` - fresh docs-only automation verdict pass
- `references/auto.md` - Codex-only controller contract and state file
- `references/quality-bar.md` - strong vs weak triage, findings, tests, and stop decisions
