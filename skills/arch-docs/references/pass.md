# Default DGTFO Pass

The default `arch-docs` invocation runs one grounded DGTFO cleanup pass:

- Discover
- Ground-truth
- Trim
- Fix
- Organize

## Goal

Leave the resolved docs scope materially healthier than before: cleaner, more current, clearer, and easier for readers to rely on, without drifting into speculative or purely aesthetic reorganization.

## Ledger contract

Create or refresh `.doc-audit-ledger.md` while the pass is active.

Recommended sections:

- `# Doc Audit Ledger`
- `## Repo Doc Profile`
- `## Inventory`
- `## History Signals`
- `## Survival Justifications`
- `## Missing Canonical Homes`
- `## Canonical Home Decisions`
- `## Topic Map`
- `## Deletions`
- `## Fixes Applied`
- `## Final Doc Map`
- `## Status`

This file is scaffolding, not a shipped artifact.

## Discover

- Inventory every doc-shaped surface in the resolved scope.
- If the run started with no narrower context, inventory the repo docs surface first, then choose the strongest grounded docs-health slice for the current pass.
- In repo-scope `auto`, the next pass may widen or shift across the repo docs surface when discovery shows more grounded docs debt elsewhere.
- Record file, location, topic, likely freshness, and overlap notes.
- Flag point-in-time docs older than 30 days as presumptively stale unless later grounding proves a current-reader need.
- Resolve repo posture and record whether the standard public-repo baseline applies.
- Record clear grounded doc gaps where current readers would expect canonical evergreen guidance but do not have it.
- In `public OSS` repos, record each missing standard community doc as a real canonical-home gap, not an optional note.
- When staleness, datedness, or one-off status matters, inspect `git log` and identify the last meaningful content change.
- Record history evidence only where it changed the keep/delete judgment.

When independent topic or doc-surface families make parallel mapping worth the
integration cost, the parent may assign non-overlapping slices to new clean
same-host native children. Codex uses `fork_turns: "none"`; Claude uses a clean
named or custom subagent rather than a bare conversation fork or skill
`context: fork` shorthand. Give each child the strongest available read-only
capability and an explicit instruction not to edit or write files, including
the ledger. Children may not fan out or invoke delegation, consult, or review
skills unless the parent assigns a bounded nested scope and budget. Bound the
wave by host slots, shared-file or shared-state collision risk, and the
parent's integration capacity. The parent captures and later compares current
git status and the relevant diff, accounts for every return, reconciles
overlap, and writes accepted mapping evidence into the ledger.

## Ground-truth

- For each topic, read the current code and current shipped behavior.
- Record contradictions across docs, code, and surviving behavior.
- Treat doc self-descriptions, folder placement, and freshness headers as untrusted claims until the code supports them.
- Identify the one best canonical home for the topic, or determine that the repo currently lacks a viable home.
- Record why the topic stays in an existing home or why it now deserves its own doc.
- Ask whether an old doc still serves a current reader need or is only preserving a point-in-time snapshot that git already remembers.
- For any point-in-time doc older than 30 days that survives, record the explicit code-grounded current-reader need in `## Survival Justifications`.
- Ask what a current reader still would not understand, trust, or be able to do if the surviving docs stayed as they are.

## Trim

- Before deleting a bounded batch of stale, duplicate, or obviously dated docs, stage those docs and create a backup git commit first.
- Stage only the docs in that delete batch, not unrelated dirty files elsewhere in the repo.
- If the backup commit cannot be created, stop instead of deleting.
- Delete stale or duplicate docs aggressively inside scope once the backup commit exists.
- Delete obviously time-bound docs once their durable truth has been folded forward and no clear lasting reader value remains.
- When a stale wrapper still contains durable truth, fold that truth into the best existing evergreen home and delete the wrapper in the same run.
- Retire obsolete working docs and completed plan/worklog residue once durable truth has been promoted.
- Repair references after every delete.

## Fix

- Correct stale surviving docs against code truth.
- Clarify confusing explanations, missing prerequisites, and misleading ordering when readers would otherwise fail or misunderstand the system.
- Expand the existing canonical home when it is the right place for grounded missing truth.
- Author a focused new canonical evergreen doc only when one of these is true:
  - the repo is `public OSS` and a standard community-doc home is missing
  - the canonical-home judgment says a differentiated evergreen topic should stand alone
- Do not promote a stale implementation-pass wrapper into a standalone evergreen doc just because it contains some useful details. If the topic fits an existing home, fold it there and delete the wrapper.
- Do not update freshness metadata unless the doc body was materially re-grounded against current code in the same pass.
- Front-load what readers actually need.
- Remove history and context that no longer helps.

## Organize

- Update the root README, docs index, or local README when surviving or newly created canonical docs need a discoverable entry.
- Keep naming and placement aligned with existing repo conventions.

## Completion bar

A pass is strong when:

- the repo doc profile is grounded
- the touched topics have one canonical home each
- stale duplicates are gone
- obviously dated docs without lasting reader value are gone or transformed in place
- point-in-time docs older than 30 days are gone unless `## Survival Justifications` records an explicit code-grounded current-reader need
- stale surviving docs are updated
- confusing docs that still matter are clarified
- grounded missing truth has been promoted into a canonical evergreen home
- no doc was made to look current through metadata-only freshness edits
- required public-repo baseline docs exist when the repo is `public OSS`
- broken references in touched scope are repaired
- durable truth was promoted before deletions
- `.doc-audit-ledger.md` is deleted before the run finishes clean, or kept only while an explicitly continuing multi-pass cleanup is still active

If those are not true yet, the pass should stop honestly with the next grounded move.
