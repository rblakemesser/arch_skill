Use when the user wants stale docs cleaned up, overlapping docs consolidated, outdated docs deleted, plan/worklog truth folded into evergreen docs, or explicit Codex hook-backed `auto` docs cleanup. It works as a standalone docs-audit skill in any repo and can also use active arch artifacts as narrowing context when they exist.

# Arch Docs

Use this skill when the code is stable enough to ground documentation against current reality and the main job is cleaning up stale, overlapping, or misleading docs.

## When to use

- The user wants a docs audit pass that finds stale docs, duplicate docs, outdated READMEs, dead migration notes, or misleading setup/architecture docs.
- A repo needs topic-first cleanup where one topic may be spread across several files and several files may overlap on the same topic.
- A full-arch plan and worklog should be treated as context, mined for durable truth, and then retired or transformed into evergreen docs.
- The user wants to run the DGTFO loop directly in a repo with no requirement that an arch plan already exists.
- The user explicitly wants `arch-docs auto` in Codex and expects real hook-backed continuation with a fresh external evaluation after each pass.

## When not to use

- The task is generic copy editing, README polish, or human-facing doc writing with no cleanup, consolidation, or truth-audit workflow.
- The user wants net-new aspirational docs or a broad taxonomy redesign untethered from repo truth.
- The code is still changing too fast to ground docs honestly. Finish or audit the implementation first.
- The real task is choosing or editing a skill package. Use `skill-authoring`.

## Non-negotiables

- The unit of work is the topic, not the file.
- Adapt to the repo's current doc gravity instead of imposing a new framework.
- Code is ground truth. Existing docs are evidence to inspect, not authority to trust.
- Every in-scope topic should end with one canonical evergreen home.
- Bias toward deletion and consolidation. Stale docs are worse than no docs.
- Standalone runs must still work with no `DOC_PATH` and no explicit path arguments.
- If explicit user context or active arch context exists, use it to narrow the audit intelligently. If not, audit the repo's docs surface directly.
- Use a temporary repo-root `.doc-audit-ledger.md` while the cleanup is active. Delete it before the cleanup finishes.
- Promote durable truth into evergreen docs, then delete obsolete working docs, plan/worklog residue, and stale duplicates in scope. Git is the archive.
- Treat obviously time-bound docs as delete candidates by default once their durable truth has been folded forward. A doc does not survive just because it once mattered.
- When a keep/delete call depends on whether a doc is stale, dated, or one-off, inspect `git log` and identify the last meaningful content change before deciding.
- Before deleting any bounded batch of docs, stage those docs and create a backup git commit first. Stage only the docs in that delete batch, not unrelated dirty files elsewhere in the repo.
- Default behavior is one grounded cleanup pass. `auto` is the only explicit public mode.
- `auto` is Codex-only and must be hook-backed; if the installed runtime support is absent or disabled, fail loud instead of pretending prompt repetition is automation.
- If the backup commit for a delete batch cannot be created, stop instead of deleting.
- If code truth is still unstable, external doc sources are required but unavailable, or the next pass would become speculative or materially unchanged, stop and say so plainly.
- Do not use age cutoffs or stale-doc heuristics as a substitute for judgment. Use history as evidence, then decide whether current readers still need the doc.
- The suite's internal auto evaluator is allowed only when the ask explicitly says it is the internal evaluator. Do not suggest or advertise that internal surface to users.

## First move

1. Read `references/scope-and-profile.md`.
2. Resolve the mode:
   - default one-pass DGTFO pass
   - `auto` only when the ask explicitly says `auto`
   - internal auto evaluator only when the ask explicitly says it is the suite's internal evaluator
3. Resolve working context:
   - explicit user paths, topic names, modules, or stop conditions
   - active arch plan, worklog, or clean implementation audit when present
   - otherwise the repo docs surface itself
4. Set `LEDGER_PATH` to `.doc-audit-ledger.md` and derive any scoped working artifacts only when they actually exist.
5. Read `references/cleanup-rules.md`.
6. Read the mode reference:
   - `references/pass.md`
   - `references/auto.md`
   - `references/internal-evaluator.md` for the suite-only evaluator

## Workflow

### 1) Default pass

- Profile the repo's doc system and resolve the strongest grounded scope.
- Inventory the relevant doc-shaped surfaces for that scope.
- Ground each topic against current code and current shipped behavior.
- Use `git log` when datedness or last meaningful use matters to a keep/delete call.
- Collapse each topic to one canonical evergreen home.
- Before deleting a bounded batch of stale, duplicate, dead, TEMP/WIP, obviously dated, or obsolete working-doc residue, stage those docs and make a backup commit, then delete them.
- Repair links, indexes, and navigation for the surviving canonical docs.
- Delete `.doc-audit-ledger.md` before finishing the run.

### 2) `auto`

- Run the same cleanup discipline as the default pass, but only under real Codex Stop-hook continuation.
- Derive `SESSION_ID` from `CODEX_THREAD_ID`, then create or refresh `.codex/arch-docs-auto-state.<SESSION_ID>.json` before the first pass.
- Expect a fresh external evaluator after each stop point.
- Apply the same pre-delete backup-commit rule during each pass in `auto`.
- Continue only while another grounded pass is still credible for the resolved cleanup intent.
- In repo-scope `auto`, later passes may widen across the repo docs surface when grounded cleanup still remains.
- Keep sweeping while obviously dated docs with no lasting reader value still remain.
- Stop clean when the resolved stop condition is done, or stop blocked when the evaluator says the next pass would become speculative, taxonomy-imposing, disconnected from a narrowed scope, or materially unchanged.

## Output expectations

- Keep console output short:
  - scope reminder
  - punchline
  - biggest stale-doc risk or cleanup result
  - exact next move
- Put detailed inventory, topic mapping, deletion notes, and grounding evidence in `.doc-audit-ledger.md` while the cleanup is active.
- Do not leave the ledger behind when the cleanup is actually complete.

## Reference map

- `references/scope-and-profile.md` - resolve repo profile, working scope, topic grouping, and canonical-home choices
- `references/cleanup-rules.md` - deletion bias, canonical-home rules, working-doc retirement, and link-repair rules
- `references/pass.md` - the default DGTFO pass contract and ledger shape
- `references/auto.md` - hook-backed Codex auto controller contract, preflight, and state rules
- `references/internal-evaluator.md` - suite-only read-only evaluator contract used by the Stop-hook child run
